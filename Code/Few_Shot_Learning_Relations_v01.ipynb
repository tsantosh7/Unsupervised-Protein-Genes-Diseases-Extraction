       "92   Based on the evidence presented we hypothesize that GC resistance in patients with MLL-disease may partly result from decreased expression and tumor suppressive effects of wild-type MLL, either through a gene-dosage effect following the functional loss of one allele via translocation, auto-regulation from the MLL-fusion protein, or altered miRNA/transcription factor signaling.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "93   It is possible that this effect could originate from the loss of tumor suppressor function of the wild-type MLL as well as from direct anti-apoptotic effects of the fusion protein.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
