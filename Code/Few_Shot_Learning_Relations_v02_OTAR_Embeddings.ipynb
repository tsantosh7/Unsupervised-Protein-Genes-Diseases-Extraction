Metabolism. 2005 Jun;54(6):719-28. Alkaptonuria, a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the HGD gene and deficiency of homogentisate 1,2 dioxygenase, is characterized by ochronosis, arthritis, and daily excretion of gram quantities of homogentisic acid (HGA). Nitisinone, an inhibitor of the enzyme 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase, can drastically reduce urinary excretion of HGA in individuals with alkaptonuria. We investigated the safety and the HGA-depleting efficacy of nitisinone in an open-label, single-center study of 9 alkaptonuria patients (5 women, 4 men; 35-69 years of age) over the course of 3 to 4 months. Each patient received nitisinone in incremental doses, 0.35 mg bid followed by 1.05 mg bid, and remained on this dosage and a regular diet for 3 months. Nitisinone reduced urinary HGA levels from an average of 4.0 +/- 1.8 (SD) g/day to 0.2 +/- 0.2 g/day ( P tyrosine concentration, initially 68 +/- 18 mmicro mol/L, rose to 760 +/- 181 micro mol/L ( P protein-restricted diet (40 g/day), and their mean plasma tyrosine level fell from 755 +/- 167 to 603 +/- 114 mu mol/L. Six of the 7 patients who received nitisinone for more than 1 week reported decreased pain in their affected joints. Weekly ophthalmologic examinations showed no signs of corneal toxicity. Adverse events included the passing of kidney stones, the recognition of symptoms related to aortic stenosis, and elevation of liver transaminase levels. We conclude that low-dose nitisinone effectively reduced urinary HGA levels in patients with alkaptonuria. Future long-term clinical trials are planned to determine the benefits of nitisinone in preventing joint deterioration and providing pain relief, and its long-term side effects.</td>\n",

Ascorbic acid treatment monitored by urinary HGA excretion. Patients with alkaptonuria lack homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase leading to retention of homogentistic acid (HGA) in body fluids and eventually to tissue deposition of oxidation products, giving rise to the clinical picture of ochronosis. Ascorbic acid is a known inhibitor of the enzyme which catalyses the oxidation of homogentisic acid (HGA) to the polymer with affinity for collagen and was used in the treatment of three siblings with alkaptonuria. Ascorbic acid 500 mg bid was administered for 12 months. Two of the siblings tolerated the treatment, and in one the symptoms improved, whereas in the other they worsened. Plasma and urinary levels of HGA were monitored with a new HPLC method. Ascorbic acid is not effective in the treatment of symptomatic ochronosis.</td>\n",

J Exp Med. 2005 Nov 21;202(10):1327-32. The bacterial pathogens of the genus Yersinia, the causative agents of plague, septicemia, and gastrointestinal syndromes, use a type III secretion system to inject virulence factors into host target cells. One virulence factor, YopJ, is essential for the death of infected macrophages and can block host proinflammatory responses by inhibiting both the nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, which might be important for evasion of the host immune response and aid in establishing a systemic infection. Here, we show that YopJ is a promiscuous deubiquitinating enzyme that negatively regulates signaling by removing ubiquitin moieties from critical proteins, such as TRAF2, TRAF6, and IkappaBalpha. In contrast to the cylindromatosis tumor suppressor CYLD, which attenuates NF-kappaB signaling by selectively removing K63-linked polyubiquitin chains that activate IkappaB kinase, YopJ also cleaves K48-linked chains and thereby inhibits proteasomal degradation of IkappaBalpha. YopJ, but not a catalytically inactive YopJ mutant, promoted deubiquitination of cellular proteins and cleaved both K48- and K63-linked polyubiquitin.

J Biol Chem. 2004 Aug 27;279(35):36171-4. Epub 2004 Jun 28. The transcription factor NF-kappaB regulates genes involved in inflammatory and immune responses, tumorigenesis, and apoptosis. In contrast to the pleiotropic stimuli that lead to its positive regulation, the known signaling mechanisms that underlie the negative regulation of NF-kappaB are very few. Recent studies have identified the tumor suppressor CYLD, loss of which causes a benign human syndrome called cylindromatosis, as a key negative regulator for NF-kappaB signaling by deubiquitinating tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor (TRAF) 2, TRAF6, and NEMO (NF-kappaB essential modulator, also known as IkappaB kinase gamma). However, how CYLD is regulated remains unknown. The present study revealed a novel autoregulatory feedback pathway through which activation of NF-kappaB by TNF-alpha and bacterium nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) induces CYLD that in turn leads to the negative regulation of NF-kappaB signaling. In addition, TRAF2 and TRAF6 appear to be differentially involved in NF-kappaB-dependent induction of CYLD by TNF-alpha and NTHi. These findings provide novel insights into the autoregulation of NF-kappaB activation.</td>\n",

Nature. 2003 Aug 14;424(6950):801-5. NF-kappaB transcription factors have key roles in inflammation, immune response, oncogenesis and protection against apoptosis. In most cells, these factors are kept inactive in the cytoplasm through association with IkappaB inhibitors. After stimulation by various reagents, IkappaB is phosphorylated by the IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex and degraded by the proteasome, allowing NF-kappaB to translocate to the nucleus and activate its target genes. Here we report that CYLD, a tumour suppressor that is mutated in familial cylindromatosis, interacts with NEMO, the regulatory subunit of IKK. CYLD also interacts directly with tumour-necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)-associated factor 2 (TRAF2), an adaptor molecule involved in signalling by members of the family of TNF/nerve growth factor receptors. CYLD has deubiquitinating activity that is directed towards non-K48-linked polyubiquitin chains, and negatively modulates TRAF-mediated activation of IKK, strengthening the notion that ubiquitination is involved in IKK activation by TRAFs and suggesting that CYLD functions in this process. Truncations of CYLD found in cylindromatosis result in reduced enzymatic activity, indicating a link between impaired deubiquitination of CYLD substrates and human pathophysiology.</td>\n",

J Biol Chem. 2005 Dec 9;280(49):41111-21. Epub 2005 Oct 17. Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) plays an important role in host defense against bacterial pathogens. Activation of TLR2 signaling not only induces the activation of innate immunity and instructs the development of the acquired immunity but also leads to the detrimental inflammatory responses in inflammatory and infectious diseases. To avoid detrimental inflammatory responses, TLR2 signaling must be tightly regulated. In contrast to the relative known positive regulation of TLR2 signaling, its negative regulation, however, is largely unknown. In addition the distal signaling components that link TLR2 to its downstream signaling pathways have yet to be further defined. In the present study we have provided direct evidence for the negative regulation of TLR2 signaling by the tumor suppressor cylindromatosis (CYLD). We showed that activation of TLR2 signaling by TLR2 ligands including peptidoglycan (PGN), MALP-2, and Pam3CSK4 induces activation of IKKs-IkappaBalpha and MKK3/6-p38 pathways not only by TRAF6 but also by TRAF7, a recently identified TRAF family member. The activation of both pathways leads to the transcription of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-8 as well as CYLD. CYLD in turn leads to the inhibition of TRAF6 and TRAF7 likely via a deubiquitination-dependent mechanism. The present studies thus unveil a novel autoregulatory feedback mechanism that negatively controls TLR2-IKKs-IkappaBalpha/MKK3/6-p38-NF-kappaB-dependent induction of immune and inflammatory responses via negatively cross-talking with both TRAF6 and TRAF7. These findings provide novel insights into autoregulation and negative regulation of TLR signaling.</td>\n",

Epub 2007 May 10. Mutations in the cylindromatosis (CYLD) gene cause benign tumors of skin appendages, referred to as cylindromas. The CYLD gene encodes a deubiquitinating enzyme that removes Lys-63-linked ubiquitin chains from I kappa B kinase signaling components and thereby inhibits NF-kappaB pathway activation. The dysregulation of NF-kappaB activity has been proposed to promote cell transformation in part by increasing apoptosis resistance, but it is not clear whether this is CYLD's only or predominant tumor-suppressing function. Here, we show that CYLD is also required for timely entry into mitosis. Consistent with a cell-cycle regulatory function, CYLD localizes to microtubules in interphase and the midbody during telophase, and its protein levels decrease as cells exit from mitosis. We identified the protein kinase Plk1 as a potential target of CYLD in the regulation of mitotic entry, based on their physical interaction and similar loss-of-function and overexpression phenotypes. Our findings raise the possibility that, as with other genes regulating tumorigenesis, CYLD has not only tumor-suppressing (apoptosis regulation) but also tumor-promoting activities (enhancer of mitotic entry). We propose that this additional function of CYLD could provide an explanation for the benign nature of most cylindroma lesions.</td>\n",

BT549 clones expressing BAF57 demonstrated marked phenotypic changes, slow growth kinetics, and restoration of contact inhibition. Altered growth was found to be due in part to cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis.

CONTEXT: RNA interference (RNAi) is the sequence-specific gene-silencing induced by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), and gives information about gene function quickly, easily, and inexpensively. The use of RNAi for genetic-based therapies is widely studied, especially in viral infections, cancers, and inherited genetic disorders. RNAi has been used to make tissue-specific knockdown mice for studying gene function in a whole animal. Combined with genomics data, RNAi-directed gene-silencing could allow functional determination of any gene expressed in a cell or pathway. The term RNAi came from the discovery that the injection of dsRNAs into Caenorhabditis elegans interferes with the expression of specific genes containing a complementary region to the delivered dsRNA. Although stalled for a time by the non-gene-specific interferon response elicited by dsRNA molecules longer than about 30 nucleotides in mammalian cells, Tom Tuschl's group found that transfection of synthetic 21-nucleotide small-interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes were highly selective and sequence-specific inhibitors of endogenous genes. STARTING POINT: siRNA expression has been studied with siRNA from plasmid and viral vectors that efficiently deliver siRNAs into both dividing and non-dividing cells, stem cells, zygotes, and their differentiated progeny. A collection of RNA interference vectors that suppress 50 human de-ubiquitinating enzymes allowed Thijn Brummelkamp and colleagues to study this gene family and to identify de-ubiquitinating enzymes in cancer-relevant pathways (Nature 2003; 424: 797-801). These researchers found that the familial cylindromatosis tumour suppressor gene (CYLD), previously of unknown function, could enhance the activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB, leading to increased resistance to apoptosis. They have now started to investigate the use of CYLD inhibitors in clinical trials. WHERE NEXT: The ability to efficiently and stably produce and deliver sufficient amounts of siRNA to the proper target tissues require refinement before this new technology can be tried clinically. Initial in-vivo studies reported effective transgene suppression in adult mice by chemically synthesised siRNAs. More recently many researchers have used plasmid and viral vectors for transcription of short-hairpin RNAs, both in vitro and in vivo. With these expression systems, gene expression was more stably inhibited than with the transient knockdown recorded with chemically synthesised siRNA. Human trials exploiting these latest findings are likely to soon follow.</td>\n",

Nature. 2003 Aug 14;424(6950):801-5. NF-kappaB transcription factors have key roles in inflammation, immune response, oncogenesis and protection against apoptosis. In most cells, these factors are kept inactive in the cytoplasm through association with IkappaB inhibitors. After stimulation by various reagents, IkappaB is phosphorylated by the IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex and degraded by the proteasome, allowing NF-kappaB to translocate to the nucleus and activate its target genes. Here we report that CYLD, a tumour suppressor that is mutated in familial cylindromatosis, interacts with NEMO, the regulatory subunit of IKK. CYLD also interacts directly with tumour-necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)-associated factor 2 (TRAF2), an adaptor molecule involved in signalling by members of the family of TNF/nerve growth factor receptors. CYLD has deubiquitinating activity that is directed towards non-K48-linked polyubiquitin chains, and negatively modulates TRAF-mediated activation of IKK, strengthening the notion that ubiquitination is involved in IKK activation by TRAFs and suggesting that CYLD functions in this process. Truncations of CYLD found in cylindromatosis result in reduced enzymatic activity, indicating a link between impaired deubiquitination of CYLD substrates and human pathophysiology.</td>\n",

Protein modification by the conjugation of ubiquitin moieties--ubiquitination--plays a major part in many biological processes, including cell cycle and apoptosis. The enzymes that mediate ubiquitin-conjugation have been well-studied, but much less is known about the ubiquitin-specific proteases that mediate de-ubiquitination of cellular substrates. To study this gene family, we designed a collection of RNA interference vectors to suppress 50 human de-ubiquitinating enzymes, and used these vectors to identify de-ubiquitinating enzymes in cancer-relevant pathways. We report here that inhibition of one of these enzymes, the familial cylindromatosis tumour suppressor gene (CYLD), having no known function, enhances activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB. We show that CYLD binds to the NEMO (also known as IKKgamma) component of the IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex, and appears to regulate its activity through de-ubiquitination of TRAF2, as TRAF2 ubiquitination can be modulated by CYLD. Inhibition of CYLD increases resistance to apoptosis, suggesting a mechanism through which loss of CYLD contributes to oncogenesis. We show that this effect can be relieved by aspirin derivatives that inhibit NF-kappaB activity, which suggests a therapeutic intervention strategy to restore growth control in patients suffering from familial cylindromatosis.</td>\n",

Nature. 2003 Aug 14;424(6950):793-6. Familial cylindromatosis is an autosomal dominant predisposition to tumours of skin appendages called cylindromas. Familial cylindromatosis is caused by mutations in a gene encoding the CYLD protein of previously unknown function. Here we show that CYLD is a deubiquitinating enzyme that negatively regulates activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB by specific tumour-necrosis factor receptors (TNFRs). Loss of the deubiquitinating activity of CYLD correlates with tumorigenesis. CYLD inhibits activation of NF-kappaB by the TNFR family members CD40, XEDAR and EDAR in a manner that depends on the deubiquitinating activity of CYLD. Downregulation of CYLD by RNA-mediated interference augments both basal and CD40-mediated activation of NF-kappaB. The inhibition of NF-kappaB activation by CYLD is mediated, at least in part, by the deubiquitination and inactivation of TNFR-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) and, to a lesser extent, TRAF6. These results indicate that CYLD is a negative regulator of the cytokine-mediated activation of NF-kappaB that is required for appropriate cellular homeostasis of skin appendages.</td>\n",

J Exp Med. 2005 Nov 21;202(10):1327-32. The bacterial pathogens of the genus Yersinia, the causative agents of plague, septicemia, and gastrointestinal syndromes, use a type III secretion system to inject virulence factors into host target cells. One virulence factor, YopJ, is essential for the death of infected macrophages and can block host proinflammatory responses by inhibiting both the nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, which might be important for evasion of the host immune response and aid in establishing a systemic infection. Here, we show that YopJ is a promiscuous deubiquitinating enzyme that negatively regulates signaling by removing ubiquitin moieties from critical proteins, such as TRAF2, TRAF6, and IkappaBalpha. In contrast to the cylindromatosis tumor suppressor CYLD, which attenuates NF-kappaB signaling by selectively removing K63-linked polyubiquitin chains that activate IkappaB kinase, YopJ also cleaves K48-linked chains and thereby inhibits proteasomal degradation of IkappaBalpha. YopJ, but not a catalytically inactive YopJ mutant, promoted deubiquitination of cellular proteins and cleaved both K48- and K63-linked polyubiquitin. Moreover, an in vitro assay was established to demonstrate directly the deubiquitinating activity of purified YopJ.</td>\n",

Mol Cell Biol. 2005 Sep;25(18):7953-65. Mutation of BRG1, hBRM, and their associated factors, INI1 and BAF57, in primary human tumors has suggested that inactivation of human SWI/SNF (hSWI/SNF) complexes may be involved in neoplastic transformation. BT549 is an invasive human breast carcinoma cell line that lacks expression of BAF57, a key hSWI/SNF subunit that mediates interaction with transcriptional activators and corepressors. In this study we investigated the role of BAF57 in suppressing tumorigenesis by establishing BT549 stable cell lines that expresses full-length BAF57 protein. BT549 clones expressing BAF57 demonstrated marked phenotypic changes, slow growth kinetics, and restoration of contact inhibition. Altered growth was found to be due in part to cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis. Furthermore, microarray analysis revealed that BAF57-mediated cell death was associated with up-regulation of proapoptotic genes including the tumor suppressor familial cylindromatosis (CYLD), which was found to be a direct target of BAF57 as determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis. Increased expression of CYLD in BT549 cells induced apoptosis, while its suppression by small interfering RNA inhibited cell death in BAF57 expressing BT549 cells. These findings demonstrate the importance of BAF57 in cell growth regulation and provide a novel link between hSWI/SNF chromatin remodelers and apoptosis.</td>\n",

J Biol Chem. 2004 Aug 27;279(35):36171-4. Epub 2004 Jun 28. The transcription factor NF-kappaB regulates genes involved in inflammatory and immune responses, tumorigenesis, and apoptosis. In contrast to the pleiotropic stimuli that lead to its positive regulation, the known signaling mechanisms that underlie the negative regulation of NF-kappaB are very few. Recent studies have identified the tumor suppressor CYLD, loss of which causes a benign human syndrome called cylindromatosis, as a key negative regulator for NF-kappaB signaling by deubiquitinating tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor (TRAF) 2, TRAF6, and NEMO (NF-kappaB essential modulator, also known as IkappaB kinase gamma). However, how CYLD is regulated remains unknown. The present study revealed a novel autoregulatory feedback pathway through which activation of NF-kappaB by TNF-alpha and bacterium nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) induces CYLD that in turn leads to the negative regulation of NF-kappaB signaling. In addition, TRAF2 and TRAF6 appear to be differentially involved in NF-kappaB-dependent induction of CYLD by TNF-alpha and NTHi. These findings provide novel insights into the autoregulation of NF-kappaB activation.</td>\n",

Gilbert's syndrome is a benign, often familial condition characterized by asymptomatic jaundice. A patient suffering from Gilbert's syndrome may have hepatic activity of bilirubin-UDP-glucuronosyltransferase decreasing to levels around 30% of the normal. A clinical diagnosis of Gilbert's syndrome is usually followed in case of mild hyperbilirubinemia with a high fraction of unconjugated bilirubin, normal values of liver enzymes, and no overt signs of hemolysis. This article reported a 17-year-old male with only partial indication of indirect hyperbilirubinemia. Rifampicin test and caloric restriction test were applied to assure the patient had Gilbert's syndrome. These two non-invasive diagnostic means, with the benefit of avoiding hazardous liver biopsy, are gaining popularity in our routine Gilbert's syndrome examination.</td>\n",

J Lab Clin Med. 1981 Jul;98(1):37-45. Implications for the diagnosis of Gilbert's syndrome. BRT and CBR were determined from studies of radiobilirubin kinetics in 14 patients undergoing splenectomy for hereditary spherocytosis. Studies were conducted both before and after the operation in order to assess the effects of the postsplenectomy fall in BRT on CBR. Splenectomy led to a doubling of the RBC-t1/2 from 13.0 +/- 1.7 (S.E.) days to 26.1 +/- 1.5 and a fall in BRT from 15.9 +/- 4.4 mg/kg/day to 4.3 +/- 0.9. In seven patients (group A) initially normal values for CBR were unaltered by surgery. In the remaining seven (group B), low preoperative values for CBR, suggestive of Gilbert's syndrome, uniformly improved after splenectomy, becoming normal in five patients. Nevertheless, family studies and reduced values for UDPGT activity supported the initial impression of concomitant Gilbert's syndrome in group B. These studies suggest the existence of a latent state for Gilbert's syndrome that, in some patients, may be unmasked by a hemolytic stress. As such, they have important implications for both pedigree analysis and incidence studies of this condition.</td>\n",

BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis (NF) is a genetic disorder of the neural sheet, affecting almost all organ systems. METHOD: A family that consisted of the father and his three children, two males and one female, having NF-1 is evaluated in detail for cosmetic purposes. The routine preoperative laboratory examinations, including complete blood counts, serum biochemistries, urinary analysis, extremity and chest roentgenograms, ultrasounds of the abdomen and the affected regions, and pelvic computed tomographies, revealed characteristics of NF-1 and unexpected hyperbilirubinemia. The patients are evaluated further for the cause of hyperbilirubinemia by the fasting test. Variously localized plexiform neurofibromas of the three children are totally excised. RESULTS: The father was affected as a result of a mutation, and his three children had inherited the disease. The father, having subcutaneous neurofibromas, differs from the children, as they have elephantiasis neurofibromatosa. The children had various rare clinical presentations besides disfiguring deformities. Two male patients had retroperitoneal neurofibromas, and one had splenomegaly and osseous changes. Gilbert's disease was diagnosed, interestingly, and coincidentally in the three patients with elephantiasis due to NF-1. DISCUSSION: An interesting diagnosis of NF occurring coincidentally with Gilbert's disease in a family is reported. This clinical study is the first report of Gilbert's disease accompanying familial NF.</td>\n",

Br J Clin Pharmacol. 2003 Aug;56(2):228-31. AIMS: To verify that Gilbert's syndrome, which is caused by decreased glucuronidation capacity of the UDP-glucuronosyl transferase (UGT) 1A1, does not account for impaired morphine clearance. METHODS: Noncompartmental pharmacokinetic parameters for morphine and its glucuronide metabolites were compared between five carriers of Gilbert's syndrome and six noncarriers after a 7.5 mg (19.8 micro mol) intravenous injection of morphine sulphate pentahydrate. To estimate the amount of morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G) formed from morphine, 1 mg of deuterized M6G was injected intravenously at the same time. RESULTS: No differences were detected between carriers and noncarriers of Gilbert's syndrome in the clearance of morphine (80.1 +/- 12 l h (-1) vs 87.9 +/- 22 l h (-1)) and in the percentage of morphine that was metabolized to M6G (10.9 +/- 1.4 vs 13 +/- 2). The areas under the plasma concentration vs time curves of morphine, M6G and morphine-3-glucuronide also did not differ between carriers and noncarriers of Gilbert's syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Gilbert's syndrome is not a factor to be considered when prescribing morphine.</td>\n",

J Clin Invest. 1991 Oct;88(4):1418-21. To understand the role of the eosinophilopoietic cytokine IL-5 in humans, the posttreatment eosinophilic response in a group of microfilaria (mf)-positive patients with onchocerciasis (n = 10) was examined before and after treatment with diethylcarbamazine (6 mg/kg for 7 d). Sequential blood samples were assessed at 24 and 1 h before treatment (baseline values), then at frequent intervals over the next 14 d. Symptom scores, skin microfilariae (mf), and peripheral blood eosinophil counts were recorded as a function of time after treatment, and serum levels of IL-5 were quantitated by a highly sensitive (sensitivity greater than or equal to 20 pg/ml) monoclonal-based ELISA. Pretreatment eosinophil counts ranged from 240 to 1,186 eosinophils/microliter (geometric mean, 675), and the mf counts from 10 to 218 per mg skin (geometric mean, 79). After an initial decline in the peripheral eosinophil count to 28 +/- 8% of pretreatment levels at 8 h after beginning treatment, the eosinophil counts steadily increased over the next 2 wk, reaching a maximum at 14 d (257 +/- 38% of pretreatment levels). Serum levels of IL-5 rose sharply from pretreatment levels to a peak of 70.5 +/- 11 pg/ml by 24 h after treatment. Serum IL-5 remained elevated over the next 2-3 d and declined toward baseline by approximately 6 d after treatment, at which time the eosinophil levels were steadily increasing. IL-3 and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor, two other cytokines implicated in eosinophilopoeisis, were not detectable in the serum at any time before or after treatment. The rise in serum IL-5 before the posttreatment eosinophilia seen in this group of patients with onchocerciasis demonstrates a temporal relationship between IL-5 and the subsequent development of eosinophilia and implicates IL-5 as an important mediator of eosinophilia in humans.</td>\n",

Clin Exp Immunol. 1994 May;96(2):238-44. The present study examined the quantitative and qualitative changes registered in the parasite-specific antibody response, cellular reactivity and cytokine production profile in onchocerciasis patients repeatedly treated with ivermectin over a period of 8 years. The densities of Onchocerca volvulus microfilariae (mf) in treated patients remained significantly reduced, whereas the number of permanently amicrofilaridermic patients (subclinical infection) increased with repeated treatments. In vitro cellular responses to O. volvulus antigen (OvAg) were highest (P volvulus (endemic normals). Cellular reactivity in repeatedly treated patients was higher at 84 than at 36 months post initial treatment (p.i.t); furthermore, the proliferative responses to OvAg, mycobacterial purified protein derivative (PPD) and streptococcal SL-O were greater (P onchocerciasis patients. In amicrofilaridermic patients such reactivity approached the magnitude observed in endemic normals. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from patients and endemic normals produced equivalent amounts of IL-2, IL-4 and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in response to mitogenic stimulation with phytohaemagglutinin (PHA); in response to OvAg, however, significantly more IL-2 and IFN-gamma were produced by PBMC from subclinical amicrofilaridermic patients or endemic normals than by mf-positive patients. OvAg-specific production of IL-4 by PBMC from treated patients was lower at 84 than at 36 months p.i.t. At three months p.i.t. the titres of circulating OvAg-specific IgG1-3 had increased (P declined with repeated treatments. Only IgG1 and IgG4 bound to OvAg of mol. wt 2-12 kD at 1 month p.i.t., while recognition of OvAg of mol. wt 10-200 kD by IgG1, IgG2 and IgG4 reached a maximum intensity at 3-6 months p.i.t., with the overall intensity of binding to OvAg gradually weakening thereafter. These results suggest that onchocerciasis-associated immunosuppression is reversible following ivermectin-induced permanent clearance of microfilariae from the skin; and that a vigorous parasite-specific cellular reactivity and a sustained production of IL-2 and IFN-gamma in amicrofilaridermic individuals may contribute to controlling O. volvulus infection.</td>\n",

Mechanisms underlying these reactions are poorly understood but may include activation of neutrophils. This study investigated the acute-phase response in onchocerciasis patients during 2 days after ivermectin treatment. The acute-phase protein C-reactive protein (CRP) and cytokines that mediate the acute-phase response (tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF alpha] and interleukin-6 [IL-6]) were measured in 144 skin snip-positive onchocerciasis patients and 12 skin snip-negative controls who received one dose of ivermectin (150 micrograms/kg). No elevated TNF alpha levels were found, but IL-6 and CRP were elevated in 25.7% and 50.7% of the patients, respectively, after ivermectin treatment. Most patients (89.2%) with raised IL-6 also had raised CRP. Such increases were not observed in controls and in patients were correlated with adverse reactions and microfilarial densities.

Clin Exp Immunol. 2007 Mar;147(3):504-12. The recommended control option against onchocerciasis is repeated ivermectin treatment, which will need to be implemented for decades, and it remains unknown how repeated ivermectin therapy might affect immunity against Onchocerca volvulus in the long term. O. volvulus-specific antibody reactivity and cellular cytokine production were investigated in onchocerciasis patients receiving ivermectin (150 microg/kg) annually for 16 years. In treated patients, the T helper type 2 (Th2) cytokine interleukin (IL)-5 and T regulatory IL-10 in response to O. volvulus antigen (OvAg) and bacteria-derived Streptolysin O (SL-O) diminished to levels found in infection-free endemic controls; also, cellular release of Th1-type interferon (IFN)-gamma at 16 years post initial ivermectin treatment (p.i.t.) approached control levels. In ivermectin-treated onchocerciasis patients, IL-5 production in responses to the mitogen phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) decreased, but IL-10 in response PHA increased, and neither attained the cytokine production levels of endemic controls. At 16 years p.i.t., O. volvulus-specific IgG1 and IgG4 subclass reactivity still persisted at higher levels in onchocerciasis patients than in O. volvulus exposed but microfilariae-free endemic controls. In addition, cytokine responses remained depressed in onchocerciasis patients infected concurrently with Mansonella perstans and Necator americanus or Entamoeba histolytica/dispar. Thus, long-term ivermectin therapy of onchocerciasis may not suffice to re-establish fully a balanced Th1 and Th2 immune responsiveness in O. volvulus microfilariae-negative individuals. Such deficient reconstitution of immune competence may be due to an as yet continuing and uncontrolled reinfection with O. volvulus, but parasite co-infections can also bias and may prevent the development of such immunity.</td>\n",

The cytokine profiles of PBMC obtained from individuals \"immune\" to Onchocerca volvulus infection were compared to those from infected individuals. The immune individuals had significantly higher levels of both IL-2 and IL-5 in response to parasite Ag than did those individuals with active infection (mean IL-2 = 1.3 and 0.138 U/ml, respectively; mean IL-5 = 973 and 147.4 pg/ml, respectively), and there was a direct correlation between the production of IL-2 and IL-5. To examine the mechanism underlying the possible association between these two cytokines in patients infected with onchocerciasis, reverse transcription followed by polymerase chain reaction was used to measure IL-5 mRNA. In response to rIL-2, IL-5 mRNA appeared as early as early as 3 h after stimulation of patient PBMC, reaching a peak at 24 h; further, this response was inhibited with neutralizing antibodies to IL-2. IL-2 was unable to induce mRNA expression for IL-4, IFN-gamma, IL-10, or granulocyte-macrophage-CSF. To assess whether IL-2 was specifically responsible for the up-regulation of Ag-induced IL-5 production in patients with onchocerciasis, IL-5 mRNA expression was measured in PBMC stimulated with parasite Ag. Up-regulation of IL-5 mRNA was seen in all patients (peaking at 72 h) in response to Ag stimulation and was found to be independent of proliferation to Ag; in addition, this up-regulation was specifically inhibited by neutralizing anti-IL-2 antibodies. Further, the primary source of IL-5 mRNA was determined to be CD4+ T cells. These findings suggest that IL-2 production is required to induce IL-5 and further implicates IL-5 as a possible mediator of protection in onchocerciasis.</td>\n",

Studies to determine the prevalence of antibodies to Onchocerca volvulus, prior to and after actions carried out to interrupt transmission, are scarce in Mexico. Here we report the prevalence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgG4 antibodies in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) against a crude extract of O. volvulus adult worm in serum samples from persons under noninterrupted biannual treatment with ivermectin in areas of onchocercosis endemicity in Mexico. To perform the prevalence studies, the ELISA procedures were first evaluated. Serological studies were performed with serum samples from skin microfilaria carriers from Guatemala and from people microfilariodermic negative living in the same area as the Guatemalan patients. Sensitivity values for IgG or IgG4 detection were 71 and 86%, while specificities were 92 and 100%, respectively. No anti-O. volvulus antibodies were found in samples from nonendemic controls from Mexico, but 3 of 71 samples from residents in the onchocercosis area of Oaxaca, Mexico, and who have been under ivermectin treatment during the last 10 years were only positive to IgG. Notwithstanding that the IgG4 isotype was not detected and a low (4.2%) anti-O. volvulus IgG antibody prevalence was found, a seroepidemiological follow-up must be performed in order to confirm interruption of onchocercosis transmission in the area of Oaxaca, Mexico, in which onchocercosis is endemic.</td>\n",

Clin Immunol. 2000 Apr;95(1 Pt 1):51-61. The roles of eotaxin, RANTES, and MCP-3 expression in eosinophil recruitment to the site of parasite killing that occurs following ivermectin treatment of onchocerciasis were assessed in the skin of 13 Onchocerca volvulus-infected subjects and two noninfected controls before and after ivermectin treatment. Adverse reactions in infected subjects were associated with the appearance of eosinophils in the dermis as part of a perivascular inflammatory infiltrate. Although no expression of RANTES and eotaxin was seen in dermal vascular endothelial cells in biopsies taken before treatment (nor at any time in the skin of uninfected controls), endothelial expression of both eotaxin and RANTES was noted by 24 h following treatment. While RANTES expression was transient, eotaxin expression increased in parallel with increasing eosinophil recruitment up to 60 h posttreatment. These observations indicate that endothelial expression of eotaxin and RANTES may have an important role in eosinophil recruitment into the skin during helminth-killing reactions.</td>\n",

Parasite Immunol. 1996 Sep;18(9):479-82. Diethylcarbamazine (DEC) induced clearance of microfilaraemia in loiasis is associated with severe posttreatment reactions. To define the switch from hypo- to hyper-responsiveness associated with DEC treatment, phenotypic alterations of T-lymphocytes, characterized by flow cytometry, and cytokines, determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, were monitored in a microfilaraemic patient. In contrast to reports on onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariases, no elevation of interleukin (IL)-6 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha was observed. The most severe side effects coincided with an elevation of interferon (IFN)-gamma on day 3, followed by IL-10, transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta 2 and macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha (MIP-1 alpha) peaking on day 5. Phenotypically, T-cell activation markers CD38, CD54 and CD25 were significantly expressed before treatment, with high CD38 expression still existing one year after clearance of microfilaraemia. Treatment-related increases were observed with anti-CD122, anti-HLA-DR and anti-CD69. CD28 was expressed before treatment on almost 100% of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and dropped to 20% by day 5, reaching again baseline levels on day 21. Furthermore, there emerged 20% TCR alpha beta+/CD3+ T cells and 10% anti-beta V5 (c)+ T cells, altogether indicating a specific pattern of T-helper (Th) 1 and Th2 cytokines as well as expansion of certain pauciclonal T-cell populations in response to microfilarial clearance.</td>\n",

Mechanisms underlying these reactions are poorly understood but may include activation of neutrophils. This study investigated the acute-phase response in onchocerciasis patients during 2 days after ivermectin treatment. The acute-phase protein C-reactive protein (CRP) and cytokines that mediate the acute-phase response (tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF alpha] and interleukin-6 [IL-6]) were measured in 144 skin snip-positive onchocerciasis patients and 12 skin snip-negative controls who received one dose of ivermectin (150 micrograms/kg). No elevated TNF alpha levels were found, but IL-6 and CRP were elevated in 25.7% and 50.7% of the patients, respectively, after ivermectin treatment. Most patients (89.2%) with raised IL-6 also had raised CRP. Such increases were not observed in controls and in patients were correlated with adverse reactions and microfilarial densities. These findings suggest a possible role of the acute-phase response in microfilarial destruction following ivermectin treatment.</td>\n",

Serum (or plasma) levels of total and mature tryptase measurements are recommended in the diagnostic evaluation of systemic anaphylaxis and systemic mastocytosis, but their interpretation must be considered in the context of a complete workup of each patient. Total tryptase levels generally reflect the increased burden of mast cells in patients with all forms of systemic mastocytosis (indolent systemic mastocytosis, smoldering systemic mastocytosis, systemic mastocytosis associated with a hematologic clonal non-mast cell disorder, aggressive systemic mastocytosis, and mast cell leukemia) and the decreased burden of mast cells associated with cytoreductive therapies in these disorders. Causes of an elevated total tryptase level other than systemic mastocytosis must be considered, however, and include systemic anaphylaxis, acute myelocytic leukemia, various myelodysplastic syndromes, hypereosinophilic syndrome associated with the FLP1L1-PDGFRA mutation, end-stage renal failure, and treatment of onchocerciasis.

The mechanisms underlying these reactions are not yet known. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether neutrophils are involved in the development of these adverse reactions. Elastase and lactoferrin, two markers for the release of neutrophil azurophilic and specific granule contents respectively, were measured by radioimmunoassays in plasma of onchocerciasis patients with varying degrees of side effects, as well as in control subjects before and 1 and 2 days after ivermectin treatment. A considerable increase of elastase levels after treatment was observed, whereas lactoferrin levels did not change. The percentage of patients with elevated elastase levels was significantly correlated with the degree of side effects.

Autoantibodies against the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) luminal protein, calreticulin are often present in sera from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatic disease and various parasitic diseases including onchocerciasis. New information has revealed that calreticulin is implicated in a number of autoimmune processes, including molecular mimicry, epitope spreading, complement inactivation and stimulation of inflammatory mediators, such as nitric oxide production. Calreticulin also binds to the Ro/SS-A antigen complex, which is composed of at least three immunologically distinct proteins bound to a group of small cytoplasmic RNAs that together form a common target for autoimmune responses. Up-regulation of calreticulin at the protein and RNA levels can be triggered by cell stresses, including heat shock, exposure to heavy metals and perturbation of normal ER function, which may in some cases lead to its secretion from cells. Calreticulin is targeted by autoantibodies following its release into the extracellular environment, possibly as a result of cell death, or its presence at the cell surface in response to insults such as viral infection or ultraviolet irradiation. These findings suggest that calreticulin is not just an autoantigen, but plays an active role in the pathology of various autoimmune disease through determinant spreading.</td>\n",

Clin Exp Immunol. 1994 May;96(2):238-44. The present study examined the quantitative and qualitative changes registered in the parasite-specific antibody response, cellular reactivity and cytokine production profile in onchocerciasis patients repeatedly treated with ivermectin over a period of 8 years. The densities of Onchocerca volvulus microfilariae (mf) in treated patients remained significantly reduced, whereas the number of permanently amicrofilaridermic patients (subclinical infection) increased with repeated treatments. In vitro cellular responses to O. volvulus antigen (OvAg) were highest (P volvulus (endemic normals). Cellular reactivity in repeatedly treated patients was higher at 84 than at 36 months post initial treatment (p.i.t); furthermore, the proliferative responses to OvAg, mycobacterial purified protein derivative (PPD) and streptococcal SL-O were greater (P onchocerciasis patients. In amicrofilaridermic patients such reactivity approached the magnitude observed in endemic normals. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from patients and endemic normals produced equivalent amounts of IL-2, IL-4 and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in response to mitogenic stimulation with phytohaemagglutinin (PHA); in response to OvAg, however, significantly more IL-2 and IFN-gamma were produced by PBMC from subclinical amicrofilaridermic patients or endemic normals than by mf-positive patients. OvAg-specific production of IL-4 by PBMC from treated patients was lower at 84 than at 36 months p.i.t. At three months p.i.t. the titres of circulating OvAg-specific IgG1-3 had increased (P declined with repeated treatments. Only IgG1 and IgG4 bound to OvAg of mol. wt 2-12 kD at 1 month p.i.t., while recognition of OvAg of mol. wt 10-200 kD by IgG1, IgG2 and IgG4 reached a maximum intensity at 3-6 months p.i.t., with the overall intensity of binding to OvAg gradually weakening thereafter. These results suggest that onchocerciasis-associated immunosuppression is reversible following ivermectin-induced permanent clearance of microfilariae from the skin; and that a vigorous parasite-specific cellular reactivity and a sustained production of IL-2 and IFN-gamma in amicrofilaridermic individuals may contribute to controlling O. volvulus infection.</td>\n",

The cytokine profiles of PBMC obtained from individuals \"immune\" to Onchocerca volvulus infection were compared to those from infected individuals. The immune individuals had significantly higher levels of both IL-2 and IL-5 in response to parasite Ag than did those individuals with active infection (mean IL-2 = 1.3 and 0.138 U/ml, respectively; mean IL-5 = 973 and 147.4 pg/ml, respectively), and there was a direct correlation between the production of IL-2 and IL-5. To examine the mechanism underlying the possible association between these two cytokines in patients infected with onchocerciasis, reverse transcription followed by polymerase chain reaction was used to measure IL-5 mRNA. In response to rIL-2, IL-5 mRNA appeared as early as early as 3 h after stimulation of patient PBMC, reaching a peak at 24 h; further, this response was inhibited with neutralizing antibodies to IL-2. IL-2 was unable to induce mRNA expression for IL-4, IFN-gamma, IL-10, or granulocyte-macrophage-CSF. To assess whether IL-2 was specifically responsible for the up-regulation of Ag-induced IL-5 production in patients with onchocerciasis, IL-5 mRNA expression was measured in PBMC stimulated with parasite Ag. Up-regulation of IL-5 mRNA was seen in all patients (peaking at 72 h) in response to Ag stimulation and was found to be independent of proliferation to Ag; in addition, this up-regulation was specifically inhibited by neutralizing anti-IL-2 antibodies. Further, the primary source of IL-5 mRNA was determined to be CD4+ T cells. These findings suggest that IL-2 production is required to induce IL-5 and further implicates IL-5 as a possible mediator of protection in onchocerciasis.</td>\n",

Clin Exp Immunol. 2007 Mar;147(3):504-12. The recommended control option against onchocerciasis is repeated ivermectin treatment, which will need to be implemented for decades, and it remains unknown how repeated ivermectin therapy might affect immunity against Onchocerca volvulus in the long term. O. volvulus-specific antibody reactivity and cellular cytokine production were investigated in onchocerciasis patients receiving ivermectin (150 microg/kg) annually for 16 years. In treated patients, the T helper type 2 (Th2) cytokine interleukin (IL)-5 and T regulatory IL-10 in response to O. volvulus antigen (OvAg) and bacteria-derived Streptolysin O (SL-O) diminished to levels found in infection-free endemic controls; also, cellular release of Th1-type interferon (IFN)-gamma at 16 years post initial ivermectin treatment (p.i.t.) approached control levels. In ivermectin-treated onchocerciasis patients, IL-5 production in responses to the mitogen phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) decreased, but IL-10 in response PHA increased, and neither attained the cytokine production levels of endemic controls. At 16 years p.i.t., O. volvulus-specific IgG1 and IgG4 subclass reactivity still persisted at higher levels in onchocerciasis patients than in O. volvulus exposed but microfilariae-free endemic controls. In addition, cytokine responses remained depressed in onchocerciasis patients infected concurrently with Mansonella perstans and Necator americanus or Entamoeba histolytica/dispar. Thus, long-term ivermectin therapy of onchocerciasis may not suffice to re-establish fully a balanced Th1 and Th2 immune responsiveness in O. volvulus microfilariae-negative individuals. Such deficient reconstitution of immune competence may be due to an as yet continuing and uncontrolled reinfection with O. volvulus, but parasite co-infections can also bias and may prevent the development of such immunity.</td>\n",

Immunology. 1999 Nov;98(3):406-12. Infection of mice with microfilariae of Onchocerca lienalis induces high levels of protective immunity to reinfection, which is dependent on interleukin (IL)-5 but not IL-4. Here, we have investigated the effect of exogenous IL-12 administration during either the priming or effector phases of the immune response. When administered during priming, IL-12 induced down-regulation of parasite-specific serum immunoglobulin (Ig) E and up-regulation of IgG2a. Antigen-specific IL-4 responses were strongly suppressed, whilst blood eosinophil levels were partially reduced. When administered during a challenge infection, IL-12 did not significantly influence the balance of antibody isotypes, but partially reduced eosinophil production. Antigen-specific IL-4 responses were again completely ablated. Unusually, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) responses were not significantly affected following IL-12 administration, either during priming or after challenge infections. Moreover, despite a fall in antigen-specific IL-5 production, the expression of IL-5-dependent immunity, as determined by reduction in worm recoveries, was fully maintained. These data demonstrate that parasite-induced IL-4 can be abrogated without affecting protective immunity to Onchocerca microfilariae in mice. In view of the established role of IL-4 in pathogenesis, this may have important implications for the development of immunoprophylaxis aimed at microfilariae and the alleviation of pathology in onchocerciasis.</td>\n",

No elevated TNF alpha levels were found, but IL-6 and CRP were elevated in 25.7% and 50.7% of the patients, respectively, after ivermectin treatment. Most patients (89.2%) with raised IL-6 also had raised CRP. Such increases were not observed in controls and in patients were correlated with adverse reactions and microfilarial densities.

Clin Immunol. 2000 Apr;95(1 Pt 1):51-61. The roles of eotaxin, RANTES, and MCP-3 expression in eosinophil recruitment to the site of parasite killing that occurs following ivermectin treatment of onchocerciasis were assessed in the skin of 13 Onchocerca volvulus-infected subjects and two noninfected controls before and after ivermectin treatment. Adverse reactions in infected subjects were associated with the appearance of eosinophils in the dermis as part of a perivascular inflammatory infiltrate. Although no expression of RANTES and eotaxin was seen in dermal vascular endothelial cells in biopsies taken before treatment (nor at any time in the skin of uninfected controls), endothelial expression of both eotaxin and RANTES was noted by 24 h following treatment. While RANTES expression was transient, eotaxin expression increased in parallel with increasing eosinophil recruitment up to 60 h posttreatment. These observations indicate that endothelial expression of eotaxin and RANTES may have an important role in eosinophil recruitment into the skin during helminth-killing reactions.</td>\n",

Metabolism. 2005 Jun;54(6):719-28. Alkaptonuria, a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the HGD gene and deficiency of homogentisate 1,2 dioxygenase, is characterized by ochronosis, arthritis, and daily excretion of gram quantities of homogentisic acid (HGA). Nitisinone, an inhibitor of the enzyme 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase, can drastically reduce urinary excretion of HGA in individuals with alkaptonuria. We investigated the safety and the HGA-depleting efficacy of nitisinone in an open-label, single-center study of 9 alkaptonuria patients (5 women, 4 men; 35-69 years of age) over the course of 3 to 4 months. Each patient received nitisinone in incremental doses, 0.35 mg bid followed by 1.05 mg bid, and remained on this dosage and a regular diet for 3 months. Nitisinone reduced urinary HGA levels from an average of 4.0 +/- 1.8 (SD) g/day to 0.2 +/- 0.2 g/day ( P tyrosine concentration, initially 68 +/- 18 mmicro mol/L, rose to 760 +/- 181 micro mol/L ( P protein-restricted diet (40 g/day), and their mean plasma tyrosine level fell from 755 +/- 167 to 603 +/- 114 mu mol/L. Six of the 7 patients who received nitisinone for more than 1 week reported decreased pain in their affected joints. Weekly ophthalmologic examinations showed no signs of corneal toxicity. Adverse events included the passing of kidney stones, the recognition of symptoms related to aortic stenosis, and elevation of liver transaminase levels. We conclude that low-dose nitisinone effectively reduced urinary HGA levels in patients with alkaptonuria. Future long-term clinical trials are planned to determine the benefits of nitisinone in preventing joint deterioration and providing pain relief, and its long-term side effects.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

Patients with alkaptonuria lack homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase leading to retention of homogentistic acid (HGA) in body fluids and eventually to tissue deposition of oxidation products, giving rise to the clinical picture of ochronosis. Ascorbic acid is a known inhibitor of the enzyme which catalyses the oxidation of homogentisic acid (HGA) to the polymer with affinity for collagen and was used in the treatment of three siblings with alkaptonuria. Ascorbic acid 500 mg bid was administered for 12 months. Two of the siblings tolerated the treatment, and in one the symptoms improved, whereas in the other they worsened. Plasma and urinary levels of HGA were monitored with a new HPLC method. Ascorbic acid is not effective in the treatment of symptomatic ochronosis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

J Exp Med. 2005 Nov 21;202(10):1327-32. The bacterial pathogens of the genus Yersinia, the causative agents of plague, septicemia, and gastrointestinal syndromes, use a type III secretion system to inject virulence factors into host target cells. One virulence factor, YopJ, is essential for the death of infected macrophages and can block host proinflammatory responses by inhibiting both the nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, which might be important for evasion of the host immune response and aid in establishing a systemic infection. Here, we show that YopJ is a promiscuous deubiquitinating enzyme that negatively regulates signaling by removing ubiquitin moieties from critical proteins, such as TRAF2, TRAF6, and IkappaBalpha. In contrast to the cylindromatosis tumor suppressor CYLD, which attenuates NF-kappaB signaling by selectively removing K63-linked polyubiquitin chains that activate IkappaB kinase, YopJ also cleaves K48-linked chains and thereby inhibits proteasomal degradation of IkappaBalpha. YopJ, but not a catalytically inactive YopJ mutant, promoted deubiquitination of cellular proteins and cleaved both K48- and K63-linked polyubiquitin. Moreover, an in vitro assay was established to demonstrate directly the deubiquitinating activity of purified YopJ.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

J Biol Chem. 2004 Aug 27;279(35):36171-4. Epub 2004 Jun 28. The transcription factor NF-kappaB regulates genes involved in inflammatory and immune responses, tumorigenesis, and apoptosis. In contrast to the pleiotropic stimuli that lead to its positive regulation, the known signaling mechanisms that underlie the negative regulation of NF-kappaB are very few. Recent studies have identified the tumor suppressor CYLD, loss of which causes a benign human syndrome called cylindromatosis, as a key negative regulator for NF-kappaB signaling by deubiquitinating tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor (TRAF) 2, TRAF6, and NEMO (NF-kappaB essential modulator, also known as IkappaB kinase gamma). However, how CYLD is regulated remains unknown. The present study revealed a novel autoregulatory feedback pathway through which activation of NF-kappaB by TNF-alpha and bacterium nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) induces CYLD that in turn leads to the negative regulation of NF-kappaB signaling. In addition, TRAF2 and TRAF6 appear to be differentially involved in NF-kappaB-dependent induction of CYLD by TNF-alpha and NTHi. These findings provide novel insights into the autoregulation of NF-kappaB activation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

Nature. 2003 Aug 14;424(6950):801-5. NF-kappaB transcription factors have key roles in inflammation, immune response, oncogenesis and protection against apoptosis. In most cells, these factors are kept inactive in the cytoplasm through association with IkappaB inhibitors. After stimulation by various reagents, IkappaB is phosphorylated by the IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex and degraded by the proteasome, allowing NF-kappaB to translocate to the nucleus and activate its target genes. Here we report that CYLD, a tumour suppressor that is mutated in familial cylindromatosis, interacts with NEMO, the regulatory subunit of IKK. CYLD also interacts directly with tumour-necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)-associated factor 2 (TRAF2), an adaptor molecule involved in signalling by members of the family of TNF/nerve growth factor receptors. CYLD has deubiquitinating activity that is directed towards non-K48-linked polyubiquitin chains, and negatively modulates TRAF-mediated activation of IKK, strengthening the notion that ubiquitination is involved in IKK activation by TRAFs and suggesting that CYLD functions in this process. Truncations of CYLD found in cylindromatosis result in reduced enzymatic activity, indicating a link between impaired deubiquitination of CYLD substrates and human pathophysiology.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

Moreover, an in vitro assay was established to demonstrate directly the deubiquitinating activity of purified YopJ.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

J Biol Chem. 2005 Dec 9;280(49):41111-21. Epub 2005 Oct 17. Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) plays an important role in host defense against bacterial pathogens. Activation of TLR2 signaling not only induces the activation of innate immunity and instructs the development of the acquired immunity but also leads to the detrimental inflammatory responses in inflammatory and infectious diseases. To avoid detrimental inflammatory responses, TLR2 signaling must be tightly regulated. In contrast to the relative known positive regulation of TLR2 signaling, its negative regulation, however, is largely unknown. In addition the distal signaling components that link TLR2 to its downstream signaling pathways have yet to be further defined. In the present study we have provided direct evidence for the negative regulation of TLR2 signaling by the tumor suppressor cylindromatosis (CYLD). We showed that activation of TLR2 signaling by TLR2 ligands including peptidoglycan (PGN), MALP-2, and Pam3CSK4 induces activation of IKKs-IkappaBalpha and MKK3/6-p38 pathways not only by TRAF6 but also by TRAF7, a recently identified TRAF family member. The activation of both pathways leads to the transcription of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-8 as well as CYLD. CYLD in turn leads to the inhibition of TRAF6 and TRAF7 likely via a deubiquitination-dependent mechanism. The present studies thus unveil a novel autoregulatory feedback mechanism that negatively controls TLR2-IKKs-IkappaBalpha/MKK3/6-p38-NF-kappaB-dependent induction of immune and inflammatory responses via negatively cross-talking with both TRAF6 and TRAF7. These findings provide novel insights into autoregulation and negative regulation of TLR signaling.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

Epub 2007 May 10. Mutations in the cylindromatosis (CYLD) gene cause benign tumors of skin appendages, referred to as cylindromas. The CYLD gene encodes a deubiquitinating enzyme that removes Lys-63-linked ubiquitin chains from I kappa B kinase signaling components and thereby inhibits NF-kappaB pathway activation. The dysregulation of NF-kappaB activity has been proposed to promote cell transformation in part by increasing apoptosis resistance, but it is not clear whether this is CYLD's only or predominant tumor-suppressing function. Here, we show that CYLD is also required for timely entry into mitosis. Consistent with a cell-cycle regulatory function, CYLD localizes to microtubules in interphase and the midbody during telophase, and its protein levels decrease as cells exit from mitosis. We identified the protein kinase Plk1 as a potential target of CYLD in the regulation of mitotic entry, based on their physical interaction and similar loss-of-function and overexpression phenotypes. Our findings raise the possibility that, as with other genes regulating tumorigenesis, CYLD has not only tumor-suppressing (apoptosis regulation) but also tumor-promoting activities (enhancer of mitotic entry). We propose that this additional function of CYLD could provide an explanation for the benign nature of most cylindroma lesions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

Mol Cell Biol. 2005 Sep;25(18):7953-65. Mutation of BRG1, hBRM, and their associated factors, INI1 and BAF57, in primary human tumors has suggested that inactivation of human SWI/SNF (hSWI/SNF) complexes may be involved in neoplastic transformation. BT549 is an invasive human breast carcinoma cell line that lacks expression of BAF57, a key hSWI/SNF subunit that mediates interaction with transcriptional activators and corepressors. In this study we investigated the role of BAF57 in suppressing tumorigenesis by establishing BT549 stable cell lines that expresses full-length BAF57 protein. BT549 clones expressing BAF57 demonstrated marked phenotypic changes, slow growth kinetics, and restoration of contact inhibition. Altered growth was found to be due in part to cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis. Furthermore, microarray analysis revealed that BAF57-mediated cell death was associated with up-regulation of proapoptotic genes including the tumor suppressor familial cylindromatosis (CYLD), which was found to be a direct target of BAF57 as determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis. Increased expression of CYLD in BT549 cells induced apoptosis, while its suppression by small interfering RNA inhibited cell death in BAF57 expressing BT549 cells. These findings demonstrate the importance of BAF57 in cell growth regulation and provide a novel link between hSWI/SNF chromatin remodelers and apoptosis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "17   Wall NR, Shi Y: Small RNA: can RNA interference be exploited for therapy? . Lancet. 2003 Oct 25;362(9393):1401-3. CONTEXT: RNA interference (RNAi) is the sequence-specific gene-silencing induced by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), and gives information about gene function quickly, easily, and inexpensively. The use of RNAi for genetic-based therapies is widely studied, especially in viral infections, cancers, and inherited genetic disorders. RNAi has been used to make tissue-specific knockdown mice for studying gene function in a whole animal. Combined with genomics data, RNAi-directed gene-silencing could allow functional determination of any gene expressed in a cell or pathway. The term RNAi came from the discovery that the injection of dsRNAs into Caenorhabditis elegans interferes with the expression of specific genes containing a complementary region to the delivered dsRNA. Although stalled for a time by the non-gene-specific interferon response elicited by dsRNA molecules longer than about 30 nucleotides in mammalian cells, Tom Tuschl's group found that transfection of synthetic 21-nucleotide small-interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes were highly selective and sequence-specific inhibitors of endogenous genes. STARTING POINT: siRNA expression has been studied with siRNA from plasmid and viral vectors that efficiently deliver siRNAs into both dividing and non-dividing cells, stem cells, zygotes, and their differentiated progeny. A collection of RNA interference vectors that suppress 50 human de-ubiquitinating enzymes allowed Thijn Brummelkamp and colleagues to study this gene family and to identify de-ubiquitinating enzymes in cancer-relevant pathways (Nature 2003; 424: 797-801). These researchers found that the familial cylindromatosis tumour suppressor gene (CYLD), previously of unknown function, could enhance the activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB, leading to increased resistance to apoptosis. They have now started to investigate the use of CYLD inhibitors in clinical trials. WHERE NEXT: The ability to efficiently and stably produce and deliver sufficient amounts of siRNA to the proper target tissues require refinement before this new technology can be tried clinically. Initial in-vivo studies reported effective transgene suppression in adult mice by chemically synthesised siRNAs. More recently many researchers have used plasmid and viral vectors for transcription of short-hairpin RNAs, both in vitro and in vivo. With these expression systems, gene expression was more stably inhibited than with the transient knockdown recorded with chemically synthesised siRNA. Human trials exploiting these latest findings are likely to soon follow.   \n",
       "18   Kovalenko A, Chable-Bessia C, Cantarella G, Israel A, Wallach D, Courtois G: The tumour suppressor CYLD negatively regulates NF-kappaB signalling by deubiquitination. Nature. 2003 Aug 14;424(6950):801-5. NF-kappaB transcription factors have key roles in inflammation, immune response, oncogenesis and protection against apoptosis. In most cells, these factors are kept inactive in the cytoplasm through association with IkappaB inhibitors. After stimulation by various reagents, IkappaB is phosphorylated by the IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex and degraded by the proteasome, allowing NF-kappaB to translocate to the nucleus and activate its target genes. Here we report that CYLD, a tumour suppressor that is mutated in familial cylindromatosis, interacts with NEMO, the regulatory subunit of IKK. CYLD also interacts directly with tumour-necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)-associated factor 2 (TRAF2), an adaptor molecule involved in signalling by members of the family of TNF/nerve growth factor receptors. CYLD has deubiquitinating activity that is directed towards non-K48-linked polyubiquitin chains, and negatively modulates TRAF-mediated activation of IKK, strengthening the notion that ubiquitination is involved in IKK activation by TRAFs and suggesting that CYLD functions in this process. Truncations of CYLD found in cylindromatosis result in reduced enzymatic activity, indicating a link between impaired deubiquitination of CYLD substrates and human pathophysiology.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

Protein modification by the conjugation of ubiquitin moieties--ubiquitination--plays a major part in many biological processes, including cell cycle and apoptosis. The enzymes that mediate ubiquitin-conjugation have been well-studied, but much less is known about the ubiquitin-specific proteases that mediate de-ubiquitination of cellular substrates. To study this gene family, we designed a collection of RNA interference vectors to suppress 50 human de-ubiquitinating enzymes, and used these vectors to identify de-ubiquitinating enzymes in cancer-relevant pathways. We report here that inhibition of one of these enzymes, the familial cylindromatosis tumour suppressor gene (CYLD), having no known function, enhances activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB. We show that CYLD binds to the NEMO (also known as IKKgamma) component of the IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex, and appears to regulate its activity through de-ubiquitination of TRAF2, as TRAF2 ubiquitination can be modulated by CYLD. Inhibition of CYLD increases resistance to apoptosis, suggesting a mechanism through which loss of CYLD contributes to oncogenesis. We show that this effect can be relieved by aspirin derivatives that inhibit NF-kappaB activity, which suggests a therapeutic intervention strategy to restore growth control in patients suffering from familial cylindromatosis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

Nature. 2003 Aug 14;424(6950):793-6. Familial cylindromatosis is an autosomal dominant predisposition to tumours of skin appendages called cylindromas. Familial cylindromatosis is caused by mutations in a gene encoding the CYLD protein of previously unknown function. Here we show that CYLD is a deubiquitinating enzyme that negatively regulates activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB by specific tumour-necrosis factor receptors (TNFRs). Loss of the deubiquitinating activity of CYLD correlates with tumorigenesis. CYLD inhibits activation of NF-kappaB by the TNFR family members CD40, XEDAR and EDAR in a manner that depends on the deubiquitinating activity of CYLD. Downregulation of CYLD by RNA-mediated interference augments both basal and CD40-mediated activation of NF-kappaB. The inhibition of NF-kappaB activation by CYLD is mediated, at least in part, by the deubiquitination and inactivation of TNFR-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) and, to a lesser extent, TRAF6. These results indicate that CYLD is a negative regulator of the cytokine-mediated activation of NF-kappaB that is required for appropriate cellular homeostasis of skin appendages.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

Mol Cell Biol. 2005 Sep;25(18):7953-65. Mutation of BRG1, hBRM, and their associated factors, INI1 and BAF57, in primary human tumors has suggested that inactivation of human SWI/SNF (hSWI/SNF) complexes may be involved in neoplastic transformation. BT549 is an invasive human breast carcinoma cell line that lacks expression of BAF57, a key hSWI/SNF subunit that mediates interaction with transcriptional activators and corepressors. In this study we investigated the role of BAF57 in suppressing tumorigenesis by establishing BT549 stable cell lines that expresses full-length BAF57 protein. BT549 clones expressing BAF57 demonstrated marked phenotypic changes, slow growth kinetics, and restoration of contact inhibition. Altered growth was found to be due in part to cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis. Furthermore, microarray analysis revealed that BAF57-mediated cell death was associated with up-regulation of proapoptotic genes including the tumor suppressor familial cylindromatosis (CYLD), which was found to be a direct target of BAF57 as determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis. Increased expression of CYLD in BT549 cells induced apoptosis, while its suppression by small interfering RNA inhibited cell death in BAF57 expressing BT549 cells. These findings demonstrate the importance of BAF57 in cell growth regulation and provide a novel link between hSWI/SNF chromatin remodelers and apoptosis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

Laminins are a family of multi-functional basement membrane proteins. Their C-terminal domain binds to cell surface receptors and is thereby responsible for cell anchorage and the initiation of specific outside-in and inside-out signals. With their N-terminal parts, laminins interact with proteins of the extracellular matrix scaffold to secure the basement membrane to the underlying mesenchymal tissue. Laminins 5A (alpha3Abeta3gamma2), 5B (alpha3Bbeta3gamma2) and 6 (alpha3Abeta1gamma1) are isoforms specific of the basement membrane underneath the epidermis and they undergo a sequential series of extracellular proteolytic changes, which might successively turn on and off one or several of their biological and mechanical functions. Under physiological conditions, such as in adult human skin, epithelial laminins have lost part of the C- and N-terminal domains of the alpha3 and gamma2 chains, respectively. In contrast, in cylindromatosis, a rare inherited disease characterised by major ultrastructural alterations of the basement membrane and altered expression/distribution of integrin receptors, laminin processing has not been completed. Together, these results suggest that laminin processing may regulate signalling pathways and the architecture of the basement membrane by restricting the repertoire of interactions with cell surface receptors and extracellular matrix components.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "23   Zhou H, Monack DM, Kayagaki N, Wertz I, Yin J, Wolf B, Dixit VM: Yersinia virulence factor YopJ acts as a deubiquitinase to inhibit NF-kappa B activation. J Exp Med. 2005 Nov 21;202(10):1327-32. The bacterial pathogens of the genus Yersinia, the causative agents of plague, septicemia, and gastrointestinal syndromes, use a type III secretion system to inject virulence factors into host target cells. One virulence factor, YopJ, is essential for the death of infected macrophages and can block host proinflammatory responses by inhibiting both the nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, which might be important for evasion of the host immune response and aid in establishing a systemic infection. Here, we show that YopJ is a promiscuous deubiquitinating enzyme that negatively regulates signaling by removing ubiquitin moieties from critical proteins, such as TRAF2, TRAF6, and IkappaBalpha. In contrast to the cylindromatosis tumor suppressor CYLD, which attenuates NF-kappaB signaling by selectively removing K63-linked polyubiquitin chains that activate IkappaB kinase, YopJ also cleaves K48-linked chains and thereby inhibits proteasomal degradation of IkappaBalpha. YopJ, but not a catalytically inactive YopJ mutant, promoted deubiquitination of cellular proteins and cleaved both K48- and K63-linked polyubiquitin. Moreover, an in vitro assay was established to demonstrate directly the deubiquitinating activity of purified YopJ.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

Together, these results suggest that laminin processing may regulate signalling pathways and the architecture of the basement membrane by restricting the repertoire of interactions with cell surface receptors and extracellular matrix components.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

Nature. 2003 Aug 14;424(6950):801-5. NF-kappaB transcription factors have key roles in inflammation, immune response, oncogenesis and protection against apoptosis. In most cells, these factors are kept inactive in the cytoplasm through association with IkappaB inhibitors. After stimulation by various reagents, IkappaB is phosphorylated by the IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex and degraded by the proteasome, allowing NF-kappaB to translocate to the nucleus and activate its target genes. Here we report that CYLD, a tumour suppressor that is mutated in familial cylindromatosis, interacts with NEMO, the regulatory subunit of IKK. CYLD also interacts directly with tumour-necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)-associated factor 2 (TRAF2), an adaptor molecule involved in signalling by members of the family of TNF/nerve growth factor receptors. CYLD has deubiquitinating activity that is directed towards non-K48-linked polyubiquitin chains, and negatively modulates TRAF-mediated activation of IKK, strengthening the notion that ubiquitination is involved in IKK activation by TRAFs and suggesting that CYLD functions in this process. Truncations of CYLD found in cylindromatosis result in reduced enzymatic activity, indicating a link between impaired deubiquitination of CYLD substrates and human pathophysiology.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

Mol Cell Biol. 2005 Sep;25(18):7953-65. Mutation of BRG1, hBRM, and their associated factors, INI1 and BAF57, in primary human tumors has suggested that inactivation of human SWI/SNF (hSWI/SNF) complexes may be involved in neoplastic transformation. BT549 is an invasive human breast carcinoma cell line that lacks expression of BAF57, a key hSWI/SNF subunit that mediates interaction with transcriptional activators and corepressors. In this study we investigated the role of BAF57 in suppressing tumorigenesis by establishing BT549 stable cell lines that expresses full-length BAF57 protein. BT549 clones expressing BAF57 demonstrated marked phenotypic changes, slow growth kinetics, and restoration of contact inhibition. Altered growth was found to be due in part to cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis. Furthermore, microarray analysis revealed that BAF57-mediated cell death was associated with up-regulation of proapoptotic genes including the tumor suppressor familial cylindromatosis (CYLD), which was found to be a direct target of BAF57 as determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis. Increased expression of CYLD in BT549 cells induced apoptosis, while its suppression by small interfering RNA inhibited cell death in BAF57 expressing BT549 cells. These findings demonstrate the importance of BAF57 in cell growth regulation and provide a novel link between hSWI/SNF chromatin remodelers and apoptosis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

Mol Cell Biol. 2005 Sep;25(18):7953-65. Mutation of BRG1, hBRM, and their associated factors, INI1 and BAF57, in primary human tumors has suggested that inactivation of human SWI/SNF (hSWI/SNF) complexes may be involved in neoplastic transformation. BT549 is an invasive human breast carcinoma cell line that lacks expression of BAF57, a key hSWI/SNF subunit that mediates interaction with transcriptional activators and corepressors. In this study we investigated the role of BAF57 in suppressing tumorigenesis by establishing BT549 stable cell lines that expresses full-length BAF57 protein. BT549 clones expressing BAF57 demonstrated marked phenotypic changes, slow growth kinetics, and restoration of contact inhibition. Altered growth was found to be due in part to cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis. Furthermore, microarray analysis revealed that BAF57-mediated cell death was associated with up-regulation of proapoptotic genes including the tumor suppressor familial cylindromatosis (CYLD), which was found to be a direct target of BAF57 as determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis. Increased expression of CYLD in BT549 cells induced apoptosis, while its suppression by small interfering RNA inhibited cell death in BAF57 expressing BT549 cells.

J Biol Chem. 2004 Aug 27;279(35):36171-4. Epub 2004 Jun 28. The transcription factor NF-kappaB regulates genes involved in inflammatory and immune responses, tumorigenesis, and apoptosis. In contrast to the pleiotropic stimuli that lead to its positive regulation, the known signaling mechanisms that underlie the negative regulation of NF-kappaB are very few. Recent studies have identified the tumor suppressor CYLD, loss of which causes a benign human syndrome called cylindromatosis, as a key negative regulator for NF-kappaB signaling by deubiquitinating tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor (TRAF) 2, TRAF6, and NEMO (NF-kappaB essential modulator, also known as IkappaB kinase gamma). However, how CYLD is regulated remains unknown. The present study revealed a novel autoregulatory feedback pathway through which activation of NF-kappaB by TNF-alpha and bacterium nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) induces CYLD that in turn leads to the negative regulation of NF-kappaB signaling. In addition, TRAF2 and TRAF6 appear to be differentially involved in NF-kappaB-dependent induction of CYLD by TNF-alpha and NTHi. These findings provide novel insights into the autoregulation of NF-kappaB activation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

Gilbert's syndrome is a benign, often familial condition characterized by asymptomatic jaundice. A patient suffering from Gilbert's syndrome may have hepatic activity of bilirubin-UDP-glucuronosyltransferase decreasing to levels around 30% of the normal. A clinical diagnosis of Gilbert's syndrome is usually followed in case of mild hyperbilirubinemia with a high fraction of unconjugated bilirubin, normal values of liver enzymes, and no overt signs of hemolysis. This article reported a 17-year-old male with only partial indication of indirect hyperbilirubinemia. Rifampicin test and caloric restriction test were applied to assure the patient had Gilbert's syndrome. These two non-invasive diagnostic means, with the benefit of avoiding hazardous liver biopsy, are gaining popularity in our routine Gilbert's syndrome examination.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

J Lab Clin Med. 1981 Jul;98(1):37-45. Implications for the diagnosis of Gilbert's syndrome. BRT and CBR were determined from studies of radiobilirubin kinetics in 14 patients undergoing splenectomy for hereditary spherocytosis. Studies were conducted both before and after the operation in order to assess the effects of the postsplenectomy fall in BRT on CBR. Splenectomy led to a doubling of the RBC-t1/2 from 13.0 +/- 1.7 (S.E.) days to 26.1 +/- 1.5 and a fall in BRT from 15.9 +/- 4.4 mg/kg/day to 4.3 +/- 0.9. In seven patients (group A) initially normal values for CBR were unaltered by surgery. In the remaining seven (group B), low preoperative values for CBR, suggestive of Gilbert's syndrome, uniformly improved after splenectomy, becoming normal in five patients. Nevertheless, family studies and reduced values for UDPGT activity supported the initial impression of concomitant Gilbert's syndrome in group B. These studies suggest the existence of a latent state for Gilbert's syndrome that, in some patients, may be unmasked by a hemolytic stress. As such, they have important implications for both pedigree analysis and incidence studies of this condition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

The patients are evaluated further for the cause of hyperbilirubinemia by the fasting test. Variously localized plexiform neurofibromas of the three children are totally excised. RESULTS: The father was affected as a result of a mutation, and his three children had inherited the disease. The father, having subcutaneous neurofibromas, differs from the children, as they have elephantiasis neurofibromatosa. The children had various rare clinical presentations besides disfiguring deformities. Two male patients had retroperitoneal neurofibromas, and one had splenomegaly and osseous changes. Gilbert's disease was diagnosed, interestingly, and coincidentally in the three patients with elephantiasis due to NF-1. DISCUSSION: An interesting diagnosis of NF occurring coincidentally with Gilbert's disease in a family is reported. This clinical study is the first report of Gilbert's disease accompanying familial NF.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

Biopharm Drug Dispos. 1993 Oct;14(7):567-78. The glutathione (GSH) S-transferases are believed to have dual functions as hepatic detoxifying enzymes and intrahepatic binding proteins. Little is known about their alterations in human liver diseases. Therefore, we have studied the relationship between the enzyme activity and rose bengal (RB) binding in hepatic cytosol and plasma indocyanine green (ICG) kinetics in patients with various liver diseases. The enzyme activity was measured in samples of hepatic cytosol obtained from 52 patients. In addition, the content of cationic and neutral transferases was estimated in 17 biopsy samples by densitometry of Coomassie blue stained sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoretograms. RB binding studies also were performed on cytosol samples. ICG kinetic parameters were determined using the two-compartment open model in 17 patients who were given the dye (0.5 mg kg-1) intravenously. Correlations between the enzyme activity and liver function tests, content of the enzyme, RB binding and ICG kinetic parameters were evaluated. The following results were obtained. (1) The enzyme activities were high in alcoholic liver disease, fatty liver and Gilbert's syndrome, and low in cirrhosis. (2) The enzyme activities were positively correlated with serum cholinesterase activity, serum albumin level and hepaplastin test, and negatively correlated with ICG retention rate at 15 min. (3) The enzyme activity, its content and RB binding affinity of the cytosol were positively correlated with each other. (4) The enzyme activity was positively correlated with hepatic ICG distribution volume. These results are consistent with the role of the GSH S-transferases as ligandins in intracellular storage of dyes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

       "73   Skarke C, Schmidt H, Geisslinger G, Darimont J, Lotsch J: Pharmacokinetics of morphine are not altered in subjects with Gilbert's syndrome. Br J Clin Pharmacol. 2003 Aug;56(2):228-31. AIMS: To verify that Gilbert's syndrome, which is caused by decreased glucuronidation capacity of the UDP-glucuronosyl transferase (UGT) 1A1, does not account for impaired morphine clearance. METHODS: Noncompartmental pharmacokinetic parameters for morphine and its glucuronide metabolites were compared between five carriers of Gilbert's syndrome and six noncarriers after a 7.5 mg (19.8 micro mol) intravenous injection of morphine sulphate pentahydrate. To estimate the amount of morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G) formed from morphine, 1 mg of deuterized M6G was injected intravenously at the same time. RESULTS: No differences were detected between carriers and noncarriers of Gilbert's syndrome in the clearance of morphine (80.1 +/- 12 l h (-1) vs 87.9 +/- 22 l h (-1)) and in the percentage of morphine that was metabolized to M6G (10.9 +/- 1.4 vs 13 +/- 2). The areas under the plasma concentration vs time curves of morphine, M6G and morphine-3-glucuronide also did not differ between carriers and noncarriers of Gilbert's syndrome.

J Clin Invest. 1991 Oct;88(4):1418-21. To understand the role of the eosinophilopoietic cytokine IL-5 in humans, the posttreatment eosinophilic response in a group of microfilaria (mf)-positive patients with onchocerciasis (n = 10) was examined before and after treatment with diethylcarbamazine (6 mg/kg for 7 d). Sequential blood samples were assessed at 24 and 1 h before treatment (baseline values), then at frequent intervals over the next 14 d. Symptom scores, skin microfilariae (mf), and peripheral blood eosinophil counts were recorded as a function of time after treatment, and serum levels of IL-5 were quantitated by a highly sensitive (sensitivity greater than or equal to 20 pg/ml) monoclonal-based ELISA. Pretreatment eosinophil counts ranged from 240 to 1,186 eosinophils/microliter (geometric mean, 675), and the mf counts from 10 to 218 per mg skin (geometric mean, 79). After an initial decline in the peripheral eosinophil count to 28 +/- 8% of pretreatment levels at 8 h after beginning treatment, the eosinophil counts steadily increased over the next 2 wk, reaching a maximum at 14 d (257 +/- 38% of pretreatment levels). Serum levels of IL-5 rose sharply from pretreatment levels to a peak of 70.5 +/- 11 pg/ml by 24 h after treatment. Serum IL-5 remained elevated over the next 2-3 d and declined toward baseline by approximately 6 d after treatment, at which time the eosinophil levels were steadily increasing. IL-3 and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor, two other cytokines implicated in eosinophilopoeisis, were not detectable in the serum at any time before or after treatment. The rise in serum IL-5 before the posttreatment eosinophilia seen in this group of patients with onchocerciasis demonstrates a temporal relationship between IL-5 and the subsequent development of eosinophilia and implicates IL-5 as an important mediator of eosinophilia in humans.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

Clin Exp Immunol. 1994 May;96(2):238-44. The present study examined the quantitative and qualitative changes registered in the parasite-specific antibody response, cellular reactivity and cytokine production profile in onchocerciasis patients repeatedly treated with ivermectin over a period of 8 years. The densities of Onchocerca volvulus microfilariae (mf) in treated patients remained significantly reduced, whereas the number of permanently amicrofilaridermic patients (subclinical infection) increased with repeated treatments. In vitro cellular responses to O. volvulus antigen (OvAg) were highest (P volvulus (endemic normals). Cellular reactivity in repeatedly treated patients was higher at 84 than at 36 months post initial treatment (p.i.t); furthermore, the proliferative responses to OvAg, mycobacterial purified protein derivative (PPD) and streptococcal SL-O were greater (P onchocerciasis patients. In amicrofilaridermic patients such reactivity approached the magnitude observed in endemic normals. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from patients and endemic normals produced equivalent amounts of IL-2, IL-4 and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in response to mitogenic stimulation with phytohaemagglutinin (PHA); in response to OvAg, however, significantly more IL-2 and IFN-gamma were produced by PBMC from subclinical amicrofilaridermic patients or endemic normals than by mf-positive patients. OvAg-specific production of IL-4 by PBMC from treated patients was lower at 84 than at 36 months p.i.t. At three months p.i.t. the titres of circulating OvAg-specific IgG1-3 had increased (P declined with repeated treatments. Only IgG1 and IgG4 bound to OvAg of mol. wt 2-12 kD at 1 month p.i.t., while recognition of OvAg of mol. wt 10-200 kD by IgG1, IgG2 and IgG4 reached a maximum intensity at 3-6 months p.i.t., with the overall intensity of binding to OvAg gradually weakening thereafter. These results suggest that onchocerciasis-associated immunosuppression is reversible following ivermectin-induced permanent clearance of microfilariae from the skin; and that a vigorous parasite-specific cellular reactivity and a sustained production of IL-2 and IFN-gamma in amicrofilaridermic individuals may contribute to controlling O. volvulus infection.                                                                                                                                                   \n",

J Infect Dis. 1994 Sep;170(3):663-8. Ivermectin treatment of onchocerciasis can induce adverse reactions. Mechanisms underlying these reactions are poorly understood but may include activation of neutrophils. This study investigated the acute-phase response in onchocerciasis patients during 2 days after ivermectin treatment. The acute-phase protein C-reactive protein (CRP) and cytokines that mediate the acute-phase response (tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF alpha] and interleukin-6 [IL-6]) were measured in 144 skin snip-positive onchocerciasis patients and 12 skin snip-negative controls who received one dose of ivermectin (150 micrograms/kg). No elevated TNF alpha levels were found, but IL-6 and CRP were elevated in 25.7% and 50.7% of the patients, respectively, after ivermectin treatment. Most patients (89.2%) with raised IL-6 also had raised CRP. Such increases were not observed in controls and in patients were correlated with adverse reactions and microfilarial densities. These findings suggest a possible role of the acute-phase response in microfilarial destruction following ivermectin treatment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

Clin Exp Immunol. 2007 Mar;147(3):504-12. The recommended control option against onchocerciasis is repeated ivermectin treatment, which will need to be implemented for decades, and it remains unknown how repeated ivermectin therapy might affect immunity against Onchocerca volvulus in the long term. O. volvulus-specific antibody reactivity and cellular cytokine production were investigated in onchocerciasis patients receiving ivermectin (150 microg/kg) annually for 16 years. In treated patients, the T helper type 2 (Th2) cytokine interleukin (IL)-5 and T regulatory IL-10 in response to O. volvulus antigen (OvAg) and bacteria-derived Streptolysin O (SL-O) diminished to levels found in infection-free endemic controls; also, cellular release of Th1-type interferon (IFN)-gamma at 16 years post initial ivermectin treatment (p.i.t.) approached control levels. In ivermectin-treated onchocerciasis patients, IL-5 production in responses to the mitogen phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) decreased, but IL-10 in response PHA increased, and neither attained the cytokine production levels of endemic controls. At 16 years p.i.t., O. volvulus-specific IgG1 and IgG4 subclass reactivity still persisted at higher levels in onchocerciasis patients than in O. volvulus exposed but microfilariae-free endemic controls. In addition, cytokine responses remained depressed in onchocerciasis patients infected concurrently with Mansonella perstans and Necator americanus or Entamoeba histolytica/dispar. Thus, long-term ivermectin therapy of onchocerciasis may not suffice to re-establish fully a balanced Th1 and Th2 immune responsiveness in O. volvulus microfilariae-negative individuals. Such deficient reconstitution of immune competence may be due to an as yet continuing and uncontrolled reinfection with O. volvulus, but parasite co-infections can also bias and may prevent the development of such immunity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "451  Steel C, Nutman TB: Regulation of IL-5 in onchocerciasis. J Immunol. 1993 Jun 15;150(12):5511-8. A critical role for IL-2. . The cytokine profiles of PBMC obtained from individuals \"immune\" to Onchocerca volvulus infection were compared to those from infected individuals. The immune individuals had significantly higher levels of both IL-2 and IL-5 in response to parasite Ag than did those individuals with active infection (mean IL-2 = 1.3 and 0.138 U/ml, respectively; mean IL-5 = 973 and 147.4 pg/ml, respectively), and there was a direct correlation between the production of IL-2 and IL-5. To examine the mechanism underlying the possible association between these two cytokines in patients infected with onchocerciasis, reverse transcription followed by polymerase chain reaction was used to measure IL-5 mRNA. In response to rIL-2, IL-5 mRNA appeared as early as early as 3 h after stimulation of patient PBMC, reaching a peak at 24 h; further, this response was inhibited with neutralizing antibodies to IL-2. IL-2 was unable to induce mRNA expression for IL-4, IFN-gamma, IL-10, or granulocyte-macrophage-CSF. To assess whether IL-2 was specifically responsible for the up-regulation of Ag-induced IL-5 production in patients with onchocerciasis, IL-5 mRNA expression was measured in PBMC stimulated with parasite Ag. Up-regulation of IL-5 mRNA was seen in all patients (peaking at 72 h) in response to Ag stimulation and was found to be independent of proliferation to Ag; in addition, this up-regulation was specifically inhibited by neutralizing anti-IL-2 antibodies. Further, the primary source of IL-5 mRNA was determined to be CD4+ T cells. These findings suggest that IL-2 production is required to induce IL-5 and further implicates IL-5 as a possible mediator of protection in onchocerciasis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

J Clin Invest. 1991 Oct;88(4):1418-21. To understand the role of the eosinophilopoietic cytokine IL-5 in humans, the posttreatment eosinophilic response in a group of microfilaria (mf)-positive patients with onchocerciasis (n = 10) was examined before and after treatment with diethylcarbamazine (6 mg/kg for 7 d). Sequential blood samples were assessed at 24 and 1 h before treatment (baseline values), then at frequent intervals over the next 14 d. Symptom scores, skin microfilariae (mf), and peripheral blood eosinophil counts were recorded as a function of time after treatment, and serum levels of IL-5 were quantitated by a highly sensitive (sensitivity greater than or equal to 20 pg/ml) monoclonal-based ELISA. Pretreatment eosinophil counts ranged from 240 to 1,186 eosinophils/microliter (geometric mean, 675), and the mf counts from 10 to 218 per mg skin (geometric mean, 79). After an initial decline in the peripheral eosinophil count to 28 +/- 8% of pretreatment levels at 8 h after beginning treatment, the eosinophil counts steadily increased over the next 2 wk, reaching a maximum at 14 d (257 +/- 38% of pretreatment levels). Serum levels of IL-5 rose sharply from pretreatment levels to a peak of 70.5 +/- 11 pg/ml by 24 h after treatment. Serum IL-5 remained elevated over the next 2-3 d and declined toward baseline by approximately 6 d after treatment, at which time the eosinophil levels were steadily increasing. IL-3 and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor, two other cytokines implicated in eosinophilopoeisis, were not detectable in the serum at any time before or after treatment. The rise in serum IL-5 before the posttreatment eosinophilia seen in this group of patients with onchocerciasis demonstrates a temporal relationship between IL-5 and the subsequent development of eosinophilia and implicates IL-5 as an important mediator of eosinophilia in humans.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

Clin Diagn Lab Immunol. 2005 Jan;12(1):40-3. Studies to determine the prevalence of antibodies to Onchocerca volvulus, prior to and after actions carried out to interrupt transmission, are scarce in Mexico. Here we report the prevalence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgG4 antibodies in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) against a crude extract of O. volvulus adult worm in serum samples from persons under noninterrupted biannual treatment with ivermectin in areas of onchocercosis endemicity in Mexico. To perform the prevalence studies, the ELISA procedures were first evaluated. Serological studies were performed with serum samples from skin microfilaria carriers from Guatemala and from people microfilariodermic negative living in the same area as the Guatemalan patients. Sensitivity values for IgG or IgG4 detection were 71 and 86%, while specificities were 92 and 100%, respectively. No anti-O. volvulus antibodies were found in samples from nonendemic controls from Mexico, but 3 of 71 samples from residents in the onchocercosis area of Oaxaca, Mexico, and who have been under ivermectin treatment during the last 10 years were only positive to IgG. Notwithstanding that the IgG4 isotype was not detected and a low (4.2%) anti-O. volvulus IgG antibody prevalence was found, a seroepidemiological follow-up must be performed in order to confirm interruption of onchocercosis transmission in the area of Oaxaca, Mexico, in which onchocercosis is endemic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

Clin Immunol. 2000 Apr;95(1 Pt 1):51-61. The roles of eotaxin, RANTES, and MCP-3 expression in eosinophil recruitment to the site of parasite killing that occurs following ivermectin treatment of onchocerciasis were assessed in the skin of 13 Onchocerca volvulus-infected subjects and two noninfected controls before and after ivermectin treatment. Adverse reactions in infected subjects were associated with the appearance of eosinophils in the dermis as part of a perivascular inflammatory infiltrate. Although no expression of RANTES and eotaxin was seen in dermal vascular endothelial cells in biopsies taken before treatment (nor at any time in the skin of uninfected controls), endothelial expression of both eotaxin and RANTES was noted by 24 h following treatment. While RANTES expression was transient, eotaxin expression increased in parallel with increasing eosinophil recruitment up to 60 h posttreatment. These observations indicate that endothelial expression of eotaxin and RANTES may have an important role in eosinophil recruitment into the skin during helminth-killing reactions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

Parasite Immunol. 1996 Sep;18(9):479-82. Diethylcarbamazine (DEC) induced clearance of microfilaraemia in loiasis is associated with severe posttreatment reactions. To define the switch from hypo- to hyper-responsiveness associated with DEC treatment, phenotypic alterations of T-lymphocytes, characterized by flow cytometry, and cytokines, determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, were monitored in a microfilaraemic patient. In contrast to reports on onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariases, no elevation of interleukin (IL)-6 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha was observed. The most severe side effects coincided with an elevation of interferon (IFN)-gamma on day 3, followed by IL-10, transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta 2 and macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha (MIP-1 alpha) peaking on day 5. Phenotypically, T-cell activation markers CD38, CD54 and CD25 were significantly expressed before treatment, with high CD38 expression still existing one year after clearance of microfilaraemia. Treatment-related increases were observed with anti-CD122, anti-HLA-DR and anti-CD69. CD28 was expressed before treatment on almost 100% of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and dropped to 20% by day 5, reaching again baseline levels on day 21. Furthermore, there emerged 20% TCR alpha beta+/CD3+ T cells and 10% anti-beta V5 (c)+ T cells, altogether indicating a specific pattern of T-helper (Th) 1 and Th2 cytokines as well as expansion of certain pauciclonal T-cell populations in response to microfilarial clearance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

This study investigated the acute-phase response in onchocerciasis patients during 2 days after ivermectin treatment. The acute-phase protein C-reactive protein (CRP) and cytokines that mediate the acute-phase response (tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF alpha] and interleukin-6 [IL-6]) were measured in 144 skin snip-positive onchocerciasis patients and 12 skin snip-negative controls who received one dose of ivermectin (150 micrograms/kg). No elevated TNF alpha levels were found, but IL-6 and CRP were elevated in 25.7% and 50.7% of the patients, respectively, after ivermectin treatment. Most patients (89.2%) with raised IL-6 also had raised CRP. Such increases were not observed in controls and in patients were correlated with adverse reactions and microfilarial densities. These findings suggest a possible role of the acute-phase response in microfilarial destruction following ivermectin treatment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

Clin Exp Immunol. 2005 Nov;142(2):318-26. Ivermectin treatment will effectively diminish microfilariae (Mf) of Onchocerca volvulus in the skin of patients, but therapy is associated with adverse host inflammatory responses. To investigate the association of proinflammatory chemokines with the intensity of infection and clinical adverse reactions, chemokine serum levels were measured in patients following ivermectin treatment (100 microg/kg, 150 microg/kg or 200 microg/kg) or placebo. The density of O. volvulus Mf per mg skin decreased by 85%, 97%, 97% and 90% at day 3, at month 3, month 6 and at 1 year post-ivermectin. The cutaneous T cell-attracting chemokine (CTACK/CCL27) was found highly elevated in onchocerciasis patients compared to infection-free European controls (P = 0.0004) and it did not change following ivermectin or placebo to 1 year post-therapy. The chemokine RANTES/CCL5 (regulated on activated and normally T cell-expressed) was similarly high in onchocerciasis patients and infection-free European controls; the RANTES/CCL5 levels did not change following treatment until 6 months post-therapy but were slightly elevated at 1 year post-therapy (P thymus and activation regulated chemokine (TARC/CCL17) and macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC/CCL22), were activated at 3 days post-ivermectin (P protein (MIP)-1alpha/CCL3 and MIP-1beta/CCL4 were low before ivermectin treatment, but following clearance of microfilariae of O. volvulus their levels increased from 6 months post-therapy onwards (for both at 12 months post-therapy, P ivermectin or with the serum levels of MIP-1alpha/CCL3, MIP-1beta/CCL4, TARC/CCL17, MDC/CCL22 and CTACK/CCL27. Our observations suggest that following ivermectin, macrophages as well as memory Th2-type lymphocytes and B cells, attracted and activated by MDC/CCL22, TARC/CCL17 and CTACK/CCL27, may contribute to dermal immune responses and O. volvulus Mf killing and clearance. The transient changes of TARC/CCL17 and MDC/CCL22 were not associated with clinical adverse responses, and the later rise of MIP-1alpha/CCL3 and MIP-1beta/CCL4 showed a reactivation of Type 1 immune responses associated with persistent low levels of O. volvulus microfilariae and an expiring O. volvulus infection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

Clin Immunol. 2000 Apr;95(1 Pt 1):51-61. The roles of eotaxin, RANTES, and MCP-3 expression in eosinophil recruitment to the site of parasite killing that occurs following ivermectin treatment of onchocerciasis were assessed in the skin of 13 Onchocerca volvulus-infected subjects and two noninfected controls before and after ivermectin treatment. Adverse reactions in infected subjects were associated with the appearance of eosinophils in the dermis as part of a perivascular inflammatory infiltrate. Although no expression of RANTES and eotaxin was seen in dermal vascular endothelial cells in biopsies taken before treatment (nor at any time in the skin of uninfected controls), endothelial expression of both eotaxin and RANTES was noted by 24 h following treatment. While RANTES expression was transient, eotaxin expression increased in parallel with increasing eosinophil recruitment up to 60 h posttreatment. These observations indicate that endothelial expression of eotaxin and RANTES may have an important role in eosinophil recruitment into the skin during helminth-killing reactions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

Serum (or plasma) levels of total and mature tryptase measurements are recommended in the diagnostic evaluation of systemic anaphylaxis and systemic mastocytosis, but their interpretation must be considered in the context of a complete workup of each patient. Total tryptase levels generally reflect the increased burden of mast cells in patients with all forms of systemic mastocytosis (indolent systemic mastocytosis, smoldering systemic mastocytosis, systemic mastocytosis associated with a hematologic clonal non-mast cell disorder, aggressive systemic mastocytosis, and mast cell leukemia) and the decreased burden of mast cells associated with cytoreductive therapies in these disorders. Causes of an elevated total tryptase level other than systemic mastocytosis must be considered, however, and include systemic anaphylaxis, acute myelocytic leukemia, various myelodysplastic syndromes, hypereosinophilic syndrome associated with the FLP1L1-PDGFRA mutation, end-stage renal failure, and treatment of onchocerciasis. Mature (beta) tryptase levels generally reflect the magnitude of mast cell activation and are elevated during most cases of systemic anaphylaxis, particularly with parenteral exposure to the inciting agent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

Ivermectin is a safe and effective drug for onchocerciasis treatment. In certain individuals, however, therapy is accompanied by adverse reactions. The mechanisms underlying these reactions are not yet known. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether neutrophils are involved in the development of these adverse reactions. Elastase and lactoferrin, two markers for the release of neutrophil azurophilic and specific granule contents respectively, were measured by radioimmunoassays in plasma of onchocerciasis patients with varying degrees of side effects, as well as in control subjects before and 1 and 2 days after ivermectin treatment. A considerable increase of elastase levels after treatment was observed, whereas lactoferrin levels did not change. The percentage of patients with elevated elastase levels was significantly correlated with the degree of side effects. These findings suggest that neutrophil activation may be involved in the development of adverse reactions in these patients.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "474  Eggleton P, Llewellyn DH: Pathophysiological roles of calreticulin in autoimmune disease. Scand J Immunol. 1999 May;49(5):466-73. Autoantibodies against the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) luminal protein, calreticulin are often present in sera from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatic disease and various parasitic diseases including onchocerciasis. New information has revealed that calreticulin is implicated in a number of autoimmune processes, including molecular mimicry, epitope spreading, complement inactivation and stimulation of inflammatory mediators, such as nitric oxide production. Calreticulin also binds to the Ro/SS-A antigen complex, which is composed of at least three immunologically distinct proteins bound to a group of small cytoplasmic RNAs that together form a common target for autoimmune responses. Up-regulation of calreticulin at the protein and RNA levels can be triggered by cell stresses, including heat shock, exposure to heavy metals and perturbation of normal ER function, which may in some cases lead to its secretion from cells. Calreticulin is targeted by autoantibodies following its release into the extracellular environment, possibly as a result of cell death, or its presence at the cell surface in response to insults such as viral infection or ultraviolet irradiation. These findings suggest that calreticulin is not just an autoantigen, but plays an active role in the pathology of various autoimmune disease through determinant spreading.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

Clin Exp Immunol. 1994 May;96(2):238-44. The present study examined the quantitative and qualitative changes registered in the parasite-specific antibody response, cellular reactivity and cytokine production profile in onchocerciasis patients repeatedly treated with ivermectin over a period of 8 years. The densities of Onchocerca volvulus microfilariae (mf) in treated patients remained significantly reduced, whereas the number of permanently amicrofilaridermic patients (subclinical infection) increased with repeated treatments. In vitro cellular responses to O. volvulus antigen (OvAg) were highest (P volvulus (endemic normals). Cellular reactivity in repeatedly treated patients was higher at 84 than at 36 months post initial treatment (p.i.t); furthermore, the proliferative responses to OvAg, mycobacterial purified protein derivative (PPD) and streptococcal SL-O were greater (P onchocerciasis patients. In amicrofilaridermic patients such reactivity approached the magnitude observed in endemic normals. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from patients and endemic normals produced equivalent amounts of IL-2, IL-4 and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in response to mitogenic stimulation with phytohaemagglutinin (PHA); in response to OvAg, however, significantly more IL-2 and IFN-gamma were produced by PBMC from subclinical amicrofilaridermic patients or endemic normals than by mf-positive patients. OvAg-specific production of IL-4 by PBMC from treated patients was lower at 84 than at 36 months p.i.t. At three months p.i.t. the titres of circulating OvAg-specific IgG1-3 had increased (P declined with repeated treatments. Only IgG1 and IgG4 bound to OvAg of mol. wt 2-12 kD at 1 month p.i.t., while recognition of OvAg of mol. wt 10-200 kD by IgG1, IgG2 and IgG4 reached a maximum intensity at 3-6 months p.i.t., with the overall intensity of binding to OvAg gradually weakening thereafter. These results suggest that onchocerciasis-associated immunosuppression is reversible following ivermectin-induced permanent clearance of microfilariae from the skin; and that a vigorous parasite-specific cellular reactivity and a sustained production of IL-2 and IFN-gamma in amicrofilaridermic individuals may contribute to controlling O. volvulus infection.                                                                                                                                                   \n",

The cytokine profiles of PBMC obtained from individuals \"immune\" to Onchocerca volvulus infection were compared to those from infected individuals. The immune individuals had significantly higher levels of both IL-2 and IL-5 in response to parasite Ag than did those individuals with active infection (mean IL-2 = 1.3 and 0.138 U/ml, respectively; mean IL-5 = 973 and 147.4 pg/ml, respectively), and there was a direct correlation between the production of IL-2 and IL-5. To examine the mechanism underlying the possible association between these two cytokines in patients infected with onchocerciasis, reverse transcription followed by polymerase chain reaction was used to measure IL-5 mRNA. In response to rIL-2, IL-5 mRNA appeared as early as early as 3 h after stimulation of patient PBMC, reaching a peak at 24 h; further, this response was inhibited with neutralizing antibodies to IL-2. IL-2 was unable to induce mRNA expression for IL-4, IFN-gamma, IL-10, or granulocyte-macrophage-CSF. To assess whether IL-2 was specifically responsible for the up-regulation of Ag-induced IL-5 production in patients with onchocerciasis, IL-5 mRNA expression was measured in PBMC stimulated with parasite Ag. Up-regulation of IL-5 mRNA was seen in all patients (peaking at 72 h) in response to Ag stimulation and was found to be independent of proliferation to Ag; in addition, this up-regulation was specifically inhibited by neutralizing anti-IL-2 antibodies. Further, the primary source of IL-5 mRNA was determined to be CD4+ T cells. These findings suggest that IL-2 production is required to induce IL-5 and further implicates IL-5 as a possible mediator of protection in onchocerciasis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

Two patients, one with Bancroftian filariasis and the other with onchocerciasis, and two healthy controls were treated with diethylcarbamazine (DEC). The natural killer (NK) cell activity of the two patients increased during DEC treatment to 2.5 and 2.8 times, respectively, while that of the controls remained unchanged. We conclude that the augmentation of baseline NK cell activity, as well as interferon- and interleukin-2-enhanced NK cell activity seen in the patients, is not a direct effect of DEC, but is related to the reaction to DEC in lymphatic filariasis and onchocerciasis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

Cell-mediated immune responses, and production and effects of IL-1 and IL-2 with Onchocerca volvulus infection. Nine of eighteen chimpanzees inoculated with infective third-stage larvae of Onchocerca volvulus developed patent infection with microfilariae in skin biopsies. In all infected chimpanzees the in vitro cellular reactivity to O. volvulus adult worm-derived Ag (OvAg) increased significantly after exposure to third-stage larvae. However, during prepatency the in vitro cellular responses to OvAg decreased gradually in subsequently mf positive (patent) animals, and returned with patency to values not different to those before infection. In non-patent chimpanzees cellular responses remained significantly higher than before infection. Stimulation of PBMC in vitro with bacterial Ag and mitogen did not show any differences between the experimental groups through 20 months p.i. The addition of exogenous IL-2 did not restore the impaired responses of PBMC to OvAg in patent animals. Exogenous IL-2 elicited an additive increase of the cellular response to OvAg in nonpatent, and a mitogenic effect to OvAg in patent animals. Selective depletion of adherent, suppressor/cytotoxic (CD8+), NK cells (CD16+) and the use of autologous serum had no effect on antigenic and mitogenic cellular responsiveness. OvAg-induced IL-2 production decreased after patency, whereas, IL-1 production was significantly greater in both patent and nonpatent than in control chimpanzees. In summary, these data demonstrate that experimental O. volvulus infection in chimpanzees stimulated a substantial cell-mediated immune response. In patent chimpanzees an OvAg-specific cellular hyporesponsiveness occurred before onset of patency, possibly due to decreased IL-2 production and responsiveness.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

Trop Med Int Health. 1997 Jul;2(7):691-4. An expression vector, pOVEX, has been designed and constructed, combining the advantages of the expression vectors pGEX-3X and pJC2o. The pOVEX vector produces a fusion protein with the 24 kD Onchocerca volvulus glutathione S-transferase (OvGST2) which is easy to purify in one step from bacterial extracts under non-denaturing conditions using glutathione-sepharose chromatography. High yields of fusion protein were produced from this T7 RNA polymerase-dependent expression vector, which were then cleaved by digestion with the factor Xa protease to separate the OVGST2 polypeptide from the expressed protein of interest. This vector will be particularly useful to O. volvulus investigators for the production of O. volvulus antigens for the analyses of host humoral and cellular responses to these proteins and for immunization studies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

Clin Exp Immunol. 2005 Nov;142(2):318-26. Ivermectin treatment will effectively diminish microfilariae (Mf) of Onchocerca volvulus in the skin of patients, but therapy is associated with adverse host inflammatory responses. To investigate the association of proinflammatory chemokines with the intensity of infection and clinical adverse reactions, chemokine serum levels were measured in patients following ivermectin treatment (100 microg/kg, 150 microg/kg or 200 microg/kg) or placebo. The density of O. volvulus Mf per mg skin decreased by 85%, 97%, 97% and 90% at day 3, at month 3, month 6 and at 1 year post-ivermectin. The cutaneous T cell-attracting chemokine (CTACK/CCL27) was found highly elevated in onchocerciasis patients compared to infection-free European controls (P = 0.0004) and it did not change following ivermectin or placebo to 1 year post-therapy. The chemokine RANTES/CCL5 (regulated on activated and normally T cell-expressed) was similarly high in onchocerciasis patients and infection-free European controls; the RANTES/CCL5 levels did not change following treatment until 6 months post-therapy but were slightly elevated at 1 year post-therapy (P thymus and activation regulated chemokine (TARC/CCL17) and macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC/CCL22), were activated at 3 days post-ivermectin (P protein (MIP)-1alpha/CCL3 and MIP-1beta/CCL4 were low before ivermectin treatment, but following clearance of microfilariae of O. volvulus their levels increased from 6 months post-therapy onwards (for both at 12 months post-therapy, P ivermectin or with the serum levels of MIP-1alpha/CCL3, MIP-1beta/CCL4, TARC/CCL17, MDC/CCL22 and CTACK/CCL27. Our observations suggest that following ivermectin, macrophages as well as memory Th2-type lymphocytes and B cells, attracted and activated by MDC/CCL22, TARC/CCL17 and CTACK/CCL27, may contribute to dermal immune responses and O. volvulus Mf killing and clearance. The transient changes of TARC/CCL17 and MDC/CCL22 were not associated with clinical adverse responses, and the later rise of MIP-1alpha/CCL3 and MIP-1beta/CCL4 showed a reactivation of Type 1 immune responses associated with persistent low levels of O. volvulus microfilariae and an expiring O. volvulus infection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

Clin Exp Immunol. 2007 Mar;147(3):504-12. The recommended control option against onchocerciasis is repeated ivermectin treatment, which will need to be implemented for decades, and it remains unknown how repeated ivermectin therapy might affect immunity against Onchocerca volvulus in the long term. O. volvulus-specific antibody reactivity and cellular cytokine production were investigated in onchocerciasis patients receiving ivermectin (150 microg/kg) annually for 16 years. In treated patients, the T helper type 2 (Th2) cytokine interleukin (IL)-5 and T regulatory IL-10 in response to O. volvulus antigen (OvAg) and bacteria-derived Streptolysin O (SL-O) diminished to levels found in infection-free endemic controls; also, cellular release of Th1-type interferon (IFN)-gamma at 16 years post initial ivermectin treatment (p.i.t.) approached control levels. In ivermectin-treated onchocerciasis patients, IL-5 production in responses to the mitogen phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) decreased, but IL-10 in response PHA increased, and neither attained the cytokine production levels of endemic controls. At 16 years p.i.t., O. volvulus-specific IgG1 and IgG4 subclass reactivity still persisted at higher levels in onchocerciasis patients than in O. volvulus exposed but microfilariae-free endemic controls. In addition, cytokine responses remained depressed in onchocerciasis patients infected concurrently with Mansonella perstans and Necator americanus or Entamoeba histolytica/dispar. Thus, long-term ivermectin therapy of onchocerciasis may not suffice to re-establish fully a balanced Th1 and Th2 immune responsiveness in O. volvulus microfilariae-negative individuals. Such deficient reconstitution of immune competence may be due to an as yet continuing and uncontrolled reinfection with O. volvulus, but parasite co-infections can also bias and may prevent the development of such immunity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

Parasite Immunol. 1996 Sep;18(9):479-82. Diethylcarbamazine (DEC) induced clearance of microfilaraemia in loiasis is associated with severe posttreatment reactions. To define the switch from hypo- to hyper-responsiveness associated with DEC treatment, phenotypic alterations of T-lymphocytes, characterized by flow cytometry, and cytokines, determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, were monitored in a microfilaraemic patient. In contrast to reports on onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariases, no elevation of interleukin (IL)-6 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha was observed. The most severe side effects coincided with an elevation of interferon (IFN)-gamma on day 3, followed by IL-10, transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta 2 and macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha (MIP-1 alpha) peaking on day 5. Phenotypically, T-cell activation markers CD38, CD54 and CD25 were significantly expressed before treatment, with high CD38 expression still existing one year after clearance of microfilaraemia. Treatment-related increases were observed with anti-CD122, anti-HLA-DR and anti-CD69. CD28 was expressed before treatment on almost 100% of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and dropped to 20% by day 5, reaching again baseline levels on day 21.

Immunology. 1999 Nov;98(3):406-12. Infection of mice with microfilariae of Onchocerca lienalis induces high levels of protective immunity to reinfection, which is dependent on interleukin (IL)-5 but not IL-4. Here, we have investigated the effect of exogenous IL-12 administration during either the priming or effector phases of the immune response. When administered during priming, IL-12 induced down-regulation of parasite-specific serum immunoglobulin (Ig) E and up-regulation of IgG2a. Antigen-specific IL-4 responses were strongly suppressed, whilst blood eosinophil levels were partially reduced. When administered during a challenge infection, IL-12 did not significantly influence the balance of antibody isotypes, but partially reduced eosinophil production. Antigen-specific IL-4 responses were again completely ablated. Unusually, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) responses were not significantly affected following IL-12 administration, either during priming or after challenge infections. Moreover, despite a fall in antigen-specific IL-5 production, the expression of IL-5-dependent immunity, as determined by reduction in worm recoveries, was fully maintained. These data demonstrate that parasite-induced IL-4 can be abrogated without affecting protective immunity to Onchocerca microfilariae in mice. In view of the established role of IL-4 in pathogenesis, this may have important implications for the development of immunoprophylaxis aimed at microfilariae and the alleviation of pathology in onchocerciasis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

Furthermore, there emerged 20% TCR alpha beta+/CD3+ T cells and 10% anti-beta V5 (c)+ T cells, altogether indicating a specific pattern of T-helper (Th) 1 and Th2 cytokines as well as expansion of certain pauciclonal T-cell populations in response to microfilarial clearance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

J Infect Dis. 1994 Sep;170(3):663-8. Ivermectin treatment of onchocerciasis can induce adverse reactions. Mechanisms underlying these reactions are poorly understood but may include activation of neutrophils. This study investigated the acute-phase response in onchocerciasis patients during 2 days after ivermectin treatment. The acute-phase protein C-reactive protein (CRP) and cytokines that mediate the acute-phase response (tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF alpha] and interleukin-6 [IL-6]) were measured in 144 skin snip-positive onchocerciasis patients and 12 skin snip-negative controls who received one dose of ivermectin (150 micrograms/kg). No elevated TNF alpha levels were found, but IL-6 and CRP were elevated in 25.7% and 50.7% of the patients, respectively, after ivermectin treatment. Most patients (89.2%) with raised IL-6 also had raised CRP. Such increases were not observed in controls and in patients were correlated with adverse reactions and microfilarial densities. These findings suggest a possible role of the acute-phase response in microfilarial destruction following ivermectin treatment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "513  Cooper PJ, Beck LA, Espinel I, Deyampert NM, Hartnell A, Jose PJ, Paredes W, Guderian RH, Nutman TB: Eotaxin and RANTES expression by the dermal endothelium is associated with eosinophil infiltration after ivermectin treatment of onchocerciasis. Clin Immunol. 2000 Apr;95(1 Pt 1):51-61. The roles of eotaxin, RANTES, and MCP-3 expression in eosinophil recruitment to the site of parasite killing that occurs following ivermectin treatment of onchocerciasis were assessed in the skin of 13 Onchocerca volvulus-infected subjects and two noninfected controls before and after ivermectin treatment. Adverse reactions in infected subjects were associated with the appearance of eosinophils in the dermis as part of a perivascular inflammatory infiltrate. Although no expression of RANTES and eotaxin was seen in dermal vascular endothelial cells in biopsies taken before treatment (nor at any time in the skin of uninfected controls), endothelial expression of both eotaxin and RANTES was noted by 24 h following treatment. While RANTES expression was transient, eotaxin expression increased in parallel with increasing eosinophil recruitment up to 60 h posttreatment. These observations indicate that endothelial expression of eotaxin and RANTES may have an important role in eosinophil recruitment into the skin during helminth-killing reactions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "518  Pedersen BK, Bygbjerg IC, Svenson M: Increase in natural killer cell activity during diethylcarbamazine treatment of patients with filariasis. Acta Trop. 1987 Sep;44(3):353-5. Two patients, one with Bancroftian filariasis and the other with onchocerciasis, and two healthy controls were treated with diethylcarbamazine (DEC). The natural killer (NK) cell activity of the two patients increased during DEC treatment to 2.5 and 2.8 times, respectively, while that of the controls remained unchanged. We conclude that the augmentation of baseline NK cell activity, as well as interferon- and interleukin-2-enhanced NK cell activity seen in the patients, is not a direct effect of DEC, but is related to the reaction to DEC in lymphatic filariasis and onchocerciasis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

These findings suggest a possible role of the acute-phase response in microfilarial destruction following ivermectin treatment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
