Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1999 Oct 12;96(21):11928-33. Hereditary tyrosinemia type I and alkaptonuria are disorders of tyrosine catabolism caused by deficiency of fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH) and homogentisic acid dioxygenase (HGD), respectively. Tyrosinemia is a severe childhood disease that affects the liver and kidneys, but alkaptonuria is a more benign adult disorder in comparison. Because HGD is upstream of FAH in the tyrosine pathway, mice doubly mutant in both enzymes were found to be protected from the liver and renal damage of tyrosinemia as hypothesized. Mice mutant at the tyrosinemic locus but heterozygous for alkaptonuria spontaneously developed clonal nodules of functionally normal hepatocytes that were able to rescue the livers of some mice with this genotype. This phenotypic rescue was a result of an inactivating mutation of the wild-type homogentisic acid dioxygenase gene, thus presenting an example of an in vivo suppressor mutation in a mammalian model.</td>\n",

Metabolism. 2005 Jun;54(6):719-28. Alkaptonuria, a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the HGD gene and deficiency of homogentisate 1,2 dioxygenase, is characterized by ochronosis, arthritis, and daily excretion of gram quantities of homogentisic acid (HGA). Nitisinone, an inhibitor of the enzyme 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase, can drastically reduce urinary excretion of HGA in individuals with alkaptonuria. We investigated the safety and the HGA-depleting efficacy of nitisinone in an open-label, single-center study of 9 alkaptonuria patients (5 women, 4 men; 35-69 years of age) over the course of 3 to 4 months. Each patient received nitisinone in incremental doses, 0.35 mg bid followed by 1.05 mg bid, and remained on this dosage and a regular diet for 3 months. Nitisinone reduced urinary HGA levels from an average of 4.0 +/- 1.8 (SD) g/day to 0.2 +/- 0.2 g/day ( P tyrosine concentration, initially 68 +/- 18 mmicro mol/L, rose to 760 +/- 181 micro mol/L ( P protein-restricted diet (40 g/day), and their mean plasma tyrosine level fell from 755 +/- 167 to 603 +/- 114 mu mol/L. Six of the 7 patients who received nitisinone for more than 1 week reported decreased pain in their affected joints. Weekly ophthalmologic examinations showed no signs of corneal toxicity. Adverse events included the passing of kidney stones, the recognition of symptoms related to aortic stenosis, and elevation of liver transaminase levels. We conclude that low-dose nitisinone effectively reduced urinary HGA levels in patients with alkaptonuria. Future long-term clinical trials are planned to determine the benefits of nitisinone in preventing joint deterioration and providing pain relief, and its long-term side effects.</td>\n",

Study of urinary homogentisic acid and a determinantion of group HLA were carried out for 36 members of a family spread over three generations with three cases of ochronotic rheumatism in the second generation. Alkaptonuria was discovered in seven other subjects, six of them members of the third generation: urinary elimination was poor, less than 0.60 g/24 hours. There is a certain degree of consanguinity in the family studied here and these findings do not therefore rule out a recessive autosomal transmission of the alkaptonuria. They do however lead to the consideration that alkaptonuria may sometimes be found in heterozygotic subjects. A genetic relationship between HLA complex and alkaptonuria can only be claimed with difficulty from this familial study, but the high frequency of B 27 antigen (29 out of 36 members carring it) leaves room for the hypothesis that the B 27 gene, or more precisely a gene associated with the B 27 gene, plays a part in the development of ochronotic rheumatism.</td>\n",

Patients with alkaptonuria lack homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase leading to retention of homogentistic acid (HGA) in body fluids and eventually to tissue deposition of oxidation products, giving rise to the clinical picture of ochronosis. Ascorbic acid is a known inhibitor of the enzyme which catalyses the oxidation of homogentisic acid (HGA) to the polymer with affinity for collagen and was used in the treatment of three siblings with alkaptonuria. Ascorbic acid 500 mg bid was administered for 12 months. Two of the siblings tolerated the treatment, and in one the symptoms improved, whereas in the other they worsened.

Epub 2007 May 10. Mutations in the cylindromatosis (CYLD) gene cause benign tumors of skin appendages, referred to as cylindromas. The CYLD gene encodes a deubiquitinating enzyme that removes Lys-63-linked ubiquitin chains from I kappa B kinase signaling components and thereby inhibits NF-kappaB pathway activation. The dysregulation of NF-kappaB activity has been proposed to promote cell transformation in part by increasing apoptosis resistance, but it is not clear whether this is CYLD's only or predominant tumor-suppressing function. Here, we show that CYLD is also required for timely entry into mitosis. Consistent with a cell-cycle regulatory function, CYLD localizes to microtubules in interphase and the midbody during telophase, and its protein levels decrease as cells exit from mitosis. We identified the protein kinase Plk1 as a potential target of CYLD in the regulation of mitotic entry, based on their physical interaction and similar loss-of-function and overexpression phenotypes. Our findings raise the possibility that, as with other genes regulating tumorigenesis, CYLD has not only tumor-suppressing (apoptosis regulation) but also tumor-promoting activities (enhancer of mitotic entry). We propose that this additional function of CYLD could provide an explanation for the benign nature of most cylindroma lesions.</td>\n",

CONTEXT: RNA interference (RNAi) is the sequence-specific gene-silencing induced by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), and gives information about gene function quickly, easily, and inexpensively. The use of RNAi for genetic-based therapies is widely studied, especially in viral infections, cancers, and inherited genetic disorders. RNAi has been used to make tissue-specific knockdown mice for studying gene function in a whole animal. Combined with genomics data, RNAi-directed gene-silencing could allow functional determination of any gene expressed in a cell or pathway. The term RNAi came from the discovery that the injection of dsRNAs into Caenorhabditis elegans interferes with the expression of specific genes containing a complementary region to the delivered dsRNA. Although stalled for a time by the non-gene-specific interferon response elicited by dsRNA molecules longer than about 30 nucleotides in mammalian cells, Tom Tuschl's group found that transfection of synthetic 21-nucleotide small-interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes were highly selective and sequence-specific inhibitors of endogenous genes. STARTING POINT: siRNA expression has been studied with siRNA from plasmid and viral vectors that efficiently deliver siRNAs into both dividing and non-dividing cells, stem cells, zygotes, and their differentiated progeny. A collection of RNA interference vectors that suppress 50 human de-ubiquitinating enzymes allowed Thijn Brummelkamp and colleagues to study this gene family and to identify de-ubiquitinating enzymes in cancer-relevant pathways (Nature 2003; 424: 797-801). These researchers found that the familial cylindromatosis tumour suppressor gene (CYLD), previously of unknown function, could enhance the activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB, leading to increased resistance to apoptosis. They have now started to investigate the use of CYLD inhibitors in clinical trials. WHERE NEXT: The ability to efficiently and stably produce and deliver sufficient amounts of siRNA to the proper target tissues require refinement before this new technology can be tried clinically. Initial in-vivo studies reported effective transgene suppression in adult mice by chemically synthesised siRNAs. More recently many researchers have used plasmid and viral vectors for transcription of short-hairpin RNAs, both in vitro and in vivo. With these expression systems, gene expression was more stably inhibited than with the transient knockdown recorded with chemically synthesised siRNA. Human trials exploiting these latest findings are likely to soon follow.</td>\n",

Protein modification by the conjugation of ubiquitin moieties--ubiquitination--plays a major part in many biological processes, including cell cycle and apoptosis. The enzymes that mediate ubiquitin-conjugation have been well-studied, but much less is known about the ubiquitin-specific proteases that mediate de-ubiquitination of cellular substrates. To study this gene family, we designed a collection of RNA interference vectors to suppress 50 human de-ubiquitinating enzymes, and used these vectors to identify de-ubiquitinating enzymes in cancer-relevant pathways. We report here that inhibition of one of these enzymes, the familial cylindromatosis tumour suppressor gene (CYLD), having no known function, enhances activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB. We show that CYLD binds to the NEMO (also known as IKKgamma) component of the IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex, and appears to regulate its activity through de-ubiquitination of TRAF2, as TRAF2 ubiquitination can be modulated by CYLD. Inhibition of CYLD increases resistance to apoptosis, suggesting a mechanism through which loss of CYLD contributes to oncogenesis. We show that this effect can be relieved by aspirin derivatives that inhibit NF-kappaB activity, which suggests a therapeutic intervention strategy to restore growth control in patients suffering from familial cylindromatosis.</td>\n",

Nature. 2003 Aug 14;424(6950):793-6. Familial cylindromatosis is an autosomal dominant predisposition to tumours of skin appendages called cylindromas. Familial cylindromatosis is caused by mutations in a gene encoding the CYLD protein of previously unknown function. Here we show that CYLD is a deubiquitinating enzyme that negatively regulates activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB by specific tumour-necrosis factor receptors (TNFRs). Loss of the deubiquitinating activity of CYLD correlates with tumorigenesis. CYLD inhibits activation of NF-kappaB by the TNFR family members CD40, XEDAR and EDAR in a manner that depends on the deubiquitinating activity of CYLD. Downregulation of CYLD by RNA-mediated interference augments both basal and CD40-mediated activation of NF-kappaB. The inhibition of NF-kappaB activation by CYLD is mediated, at least in part, by the deubiquitination and inactivation of TNFR-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) and, to a lesser extent, TRAF6. These results indicate that CYLD is a negative regulator of the cytokine-mediated activation of NF-kappaB that is required for appropriate cellular homeostasis of skin appendages.</td>\n",

The mono-acetylated metabolite of RGB has some pharmacological activity and is denoted AWD21-360. We investigated whether the pharmacokinetics (PK) of RGB and AWD21-360 are altered in subjects with Gilbert's syndrome (GS) and/or with frequent N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) slow acetylator (SA) polymorphisms. Based on consistent genotyping and phenotyping screening results, 37 Caucasian subjects (21-46 years; 31 men, six women) were assigned to one of the following groups: (1) absence of GS (non-GS)/rapid acetylator (RA) (N=11); (2) GS/RA (N=8); (3) non-GS/SA (N=11); (4) GS/SA (N=7). Subjects received single and multiple (b.i.d.) 200-mg oral RGB doses over 5 days. Blood samples were collected up to 60 h after dosing for plasma PK of RGB and AWD21-360. Group comparisons were performed by ANOVA. Single-dose PK of RGB and AWD21-360 and multiple-dose PK of RGB did not differ significantly between groups. After multiple dose treatment, RA subjects showed a significantly higher total exposure to AWD21-360 of about 32% (95% CI 101.9-172.5) relative to SA subjects (P=0.0362). The UGT1A1 metabolic capacity (i.e. presence or absence of GS), however, did not significantly affect the overall exposure to AWD21-360. The results indicate that the PK of RGB is unaltered in individuals with GS, in subjects with NAT2 SA status, and in carriers of both variants, whereas the total exposure to AWD21-360 is significantly related to the RA or SA status of subjects. Results further suggest that metabolic switching to the mono-acetylated metabolite AWD21-360 may partially compensate for the impaired glucuronidation capacity in GS subjects. RGB treatment showed no significant differences in tolerability and safety between groups.</td>\n",

J Lab Clin Med. 1981 Jul;98(1):37-45. Implications for the diagnosis of Gilbert's syndrome. BRT and CBR were determined from studies of radiobilirubin kinetics in 14 patients undergoing splenectomy for hereditary spherocytosis. Studies were conducted both before and after the operation in order to assess the effects of the postsplenectomy fall in BRT on CBR. Splenectomy led to a doubling of the RBC-t1/2 from 13.0 +/- 1.7 (S.E.) days to 26.1 +/- 1.5 and a fall in BRT from 15.9 +/- 4.4 mg/kg/day to 4.3 +/- 0.9. In seven patients (group A) initially normal values for CBR were unaltered by surgery. In the remaining seven (group B), low preoperative values for CBR, suggestive of Gilbert's syndrome, uniformly improved after splenectomy, becoming normal in five patients. Nevertheless, family studies and reduced values for UDPGT activity supported the initial impression of concomitant Gilbert's syndrome in group B. These studies suggest the existence of a latent state for Gilbert's syndrome that, in some patients, may be unmasked by a hemolytic stress. As such, they have important implications for both pedigree analysis and incidence studies of this condition.</td>\n",

In patients with Gilbert's syndrome, both bilirubin clearance and in vitro hepatic microsomal uridine diphosphoglucuronyl transferase (UDPGT) activity are reduced. In addition, there is evidence suggesting impaired hepatic uptake of bilirubin in Gilbert's syndrome.

The molecular basis for the considerable variation of serum bilirubin levels and the incidence of gallstone formation in patients with congenital dyserythropoietic anemia (CDA) type II are unknown.

Additionally, extra nucleotides of (TA) in the A (TA) n TAA motif of the promoter region of the uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase gene (UGT-1 A) were found to be homozygous in the patient.

Br J Clin Pharmacol. 2003 Aug;56(2):228-31. AIMS: To verify that Gilbert's syndrome, which is caused by decreased glucuronidation capacity of the UDP-glucuronosyl transferase (UGT) 1A1, does not account for impaired morphine clearance. METHODS: Noncompartmental pharmacokinetic parameters for morphine and its glucuronide metabolites were compared between five carriers of Gilbert's syndrome and six noncarriers after a 7.5 mg (19.8 micro mol) intravenous injection of morphine sulphate pentahydrate. To estimate the amount of morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G) formed from morphine, 1 mg of deuterized M6G was injected intravenously at the same time. RESULTS: No differences were detected between carriers and noncarriers of Gilbert's syndrome in the clearance of morphine (80.1 +/- 12 l h (-1) vs 87.9 +/- 22 l h (-1)) and in the percentage of morphine that was metabolized to M6G (10.9 +/- 1.4 vs 13 +/- 2). The areas under the plasma concentration vs time curves of morphine, M6G and morphine-3-glucuronide also did not differ between carriers and noncarriers of Gilbert's syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Gilbert's syndrome is not a factor to be considered when prescribing morphine.</td>\n",

Pharmacogenomics J. 2006 May-Jun;6(3):211-9. Retigabine (RGB) is an investigational antiepileptic drug, which undergoes extensive UGT1A1, 1A9 and 1A4-mediated N-glucuronidation and N-acetylation. The mono-acetylated metabolite of RGB has some pharmacological activity and is denoted AWD21-360. We investigated whether the pharmacokinetics (PK) of RGB and AWD21-360 are altered in subjects with Gilbert's syndrome (GS) and/or with frequent N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) slow acetylator (SA) polymorphisms. Based on consistent genotyping and phenotyping screening results, 37 Caucasian subjects (21-46 years; 31 men, six women) were assigned to one of the following groups: (1) absence of GS (non-GS)/rapid acetylator (RA) (N=11); (2) GS/RA (N=8); (3) non-GS/SA (N=11); (4) GS/SA (N=7). Subjects received single and multiple (b.i.d.) 200-mg oral RGB doses over 5 days. Blood samples were collected up to 60 h after dosing for plasma PK of RGB and AWD21-360. Group comparisons were performed by ANOVA. Single-dose PK of RGB and AWD21-360 and multiple-dose PK of RGB did not differ significantly between groups. After multiple dose treatment, RA subjects showed a significantly higher total exposure to AWD21-360 of about 32% (95% CI 101.9-172.5) relative to SA subjects (P=0.0362). The UGT1A1 metabolic capacity (i.e. presence or absence of GS), however, did not significantly affect the overall exposure to AWD21-360. The results indicate that the PK of RGB is unaltered in individuals with GS, in subjects with NAT2 SA status, and in carriers of both variants, whereas the total exposure to AWD21-360 is significantly related to the RA or SA status of subjects. Results further suggest that metabolic switching to the mono-acetylated metabolite AWD21-360 may partially compensate for the impaired glucuronidation capacity in GS subjects. RGB treatment showed no significant differences in tolerability and safety between groups.</td>\n",

Hepatology. 2006 Apr;43(4):738-41. The prevalence of \"black\" pigment gallstones is increased in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Bile acid malabsorption with augmented bilirubin uptake from the intestine and the development of \"hyperbilirubinbilia\" have been proposed as key factors in gallstone formation in CF patients. We have now tested the hypothesis that the coinheritance of the common UGT1A1 promoter mutation associated with Gilbert syndrome is an additional lithogenic risk factor for gallstone formation in CF. Our results show that patients with CF and gallstones are significantly more likely to carry at least one Gilbert UGT1A1 allele compared with stone-free patients (OR 7.3; P = .042) and that these carriers display significantly higher serum levels of unconjugated bilirubin (P = .002). In conclusion, the Gilbert UGT1A1 allele increases the risk of gallstone formation in CF. This genetic association supports the current concept for gallstone formation in CF and suggests that genetic and exogenous sources contributing to hyperbilirubinbilia might be lithogenic in CF patients.</td>\n",

Glucuronidation of drugs by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) is a major phase II conjugation reaction. Defects in UGT are associated with Crigler-Najjar syndrome and Gilbert's syndrome with severe hyperbilirubinaemias and jaundice. We analysed the reactivities of some hydroxyquinoline derivatives, which are naturally produced from quinoline by cytochrome P450. The analyses were carried out using a microassay system for UGT activity in bovine liver microsomes in the range 0.5-100 pmol/assay with the highly sensitive radio-image analyser Fuji BAS2500 (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan). 3-Hydroxylquinoline is a good substrate for glucuronidation, and the relative Kcat values were 3.1-fold higher than the values for p-nitrophenol. 5,6-Dihydroquinoline-5,6-trans-diol gave a similar Km value to that of 3-hydroxyquinoline, but the Vmax value was approximately 1/15 of that of p-nitrophenol and showed weak reactivity. Quinoline N-oxide gave a low Vmax value and showed marginal activity. The Kcat values of 6-hydroxyquinoline and 5-hydroxyquinoline were 2.1- and 1.2-fold higher than that of p-nitrophenol, respectively. Fluoroquinoline (FQ) derivatives, such as 3FQ, 7.8diFQ and 6,7,8triFQ, did not show any substrate activities. These results suggest that there are therapeutic problems in administration of some quinoline drugs to patients with jaundice.</td>\n",

Clin Exp Immunol. 2007 Mar;147(3):504-12. The recommended control option against onchocerciasis is repeated ivermectin treatment, which will need to be implemented for decades, and it remains unknown how repeated ivermectin therapy might affect immunity against Onchocerca volvulus in the long term. O. volvulus-specific antibody reactivity and cellular cytokine production were investigated in onchocerciasis patients receiving ivermectin (150 microg/kg) annually for 16 years. In treated patients, the T helper type 2 (Th2) cytokine interleukin (IL)-5 and T regulatory IL-10 in response to O. volvulus antigen (OvAg) and bacteria-derived Streptolysin O (SL-O) diminished to levels found in infection-free endemic controls; also, cellular release of Th1-type interferon (IFN)-gamma at 16 years post initial ivermectin treatment (p.i.t.) approached control levels. In ivermectin-treated onchocerciasis patients, IL-5 production in responses to the mitogen phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) decreased, but IL-10 in response PHA increased, and neither attained the cytokine production levels of endemic controls. At 16 years p.i.t., O. volvulus-specific IgG1 and IgG4 subclass reactivity still persisted at higher levels in onchocerciasis patients than in O. volvulus exposed but microfilariae-free endemic controls. In addition, cytokine responses remained depressed in onchocerciasis patients infected concurrently with Mansonella perstans and Necator americanus or Entamoeba histolytica/dispar. Thus, long-term ivermectin therapy of onchocerciasis may not suffice to re-establish fully a balanced Th1 and Th2 immune responsiveness in O. volvulus microfilariae-negative individuals. Such deficient reconstitution of immune competence may be due to an as yet continuing and uncontrolled reinfection with O. volvulus, but parasite co-infections can also bias and may prevent the development of such immunity.</td>\n",

J Clin Invest. 1991 Oct;88(4):1418-21. To understand the role of the eosinophilopoietic cytokine IL-5 in humans, the posttreatment eosinophilic response in a group of microfilaria (mf)-positive patients with onchocerciasis (n = 10) was examined before and after treatment with diethylcarbamazine (6 mg/kg for 7 d). Sequential blood samples were assessed at 24 and 1 h before treatment (baseline values), then at frequent intervals over the next 14 d. Symptom scores, skin microfilariae (mf), and peripheral blood eosinophil counts were recorded as a function of time after treatment, and serum levels of IL-5 were quantitated by a highly sensitive (sensitivity greater than or equal to 20 pg/ml) monoclonal-based ELISA. Pretreatment eosinophil counts ranged from 240 to 1,186 eosinophils/microliter (geometric mean, 675), and the mf counts from 10 to 218 per mg skin (geometric mean, 79). After an initial decline in the peripheral eosinophil count to 28 +/- 8% of pretreatment levels at 8 h after beginning treatment, the eosinophil counts steadily increased over the next 2 wk, reaching a maximum at 14 d (257 +/- 38% of pretreatment levels). Serum levels of IL-5 rose sharply from pretreatment levels to a peak of 70.5 +/- 11 pg/ml by 24 h after treatment. Serum IL-5 remained elevated over the next 2-3 d and declined toward baseline by approximately 6 d after treatment, at which time the eosinophil levels were steadily increasing. IL-3 and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor, two other cytokines implicated in eosinophilopoeisis, were not detectable in the serum at any time before or after treatment. The rise in serum IL-5 before the posttreatment eosinophilia seen in this group of patients with onchocerciasis demonstrates a temporal relationship between IL-5 and the subsequent development of eosinophilia and implicates IL-5 as an important mediator of eosinophilia in humans.</td>\n",

Studies to determine the prevalence of antibodies to Onchocerca volvulus, prior to and after actions carried out to interrupt transmission, are scarce in Mexico. Here we report the prevalence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgG4 antibodies in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) against a crude extract of O. volvulus adult worm in serum samples from persons under noninterrupted biannual treatment with ivermectin in areas of onchocercosis endemicity in Mexico. To perform the prevalence studies, the ELISA procedures were first evaluated. Serological studies were performed with serum samples from skin microfilaria carriers from Guatemala and from people microfilariodermic negative living in the same area as the Guatemalan patients. Sensitivity values for IgG or IgG4 detection were 71 and 86%, while specificities were 92 and 100%, respectively. No anti-O. volvulus antibodies were found in samples from nonendemic controls from Mexico, but 3 of 71 samples from residents in the onchocercosis area of Oaxaca, Mexico, and who have been under ivermectin treatment during the last 10 years were only positive to IgG. Notwithstanding that the IgG4 isotype was not detected and a low (4.2%) anti-O. volvulus IgG antibody prevalence was found, a seroepidemiological follow-up must be performed in order to confirm interruption of onchocercosis transmission in the area of Oaxaca, Mexico, in which onchocercosis is endemic.</td>\n",

Clin Exp Immunol. 1988 Nov;74(2):223-9. Individual human Ig class responses to Onchocerca volvulus antigens have been evaluated by Western blotting using sera from cases of generalized onchocerciasis and chronic hyper-reactive onchocerciasis (Sowda). in all cases except IgG3 the patterns of recognition by human antibody classes were similar in Sowda and generalized onchocerciasis. Weak or undetectable responses were seen with IgG1, IgG2 and IgM. The total profiles of antigens recognized by the other Ig classes were different, although in some cases certain bands were commonly identified. The result with IgG3, however, was striking. Here, two major antigens (9 kD and 72kD) were recognized by IgG3 antibodies in Sowda sera but not generalized onchocerciasis sera. Furthermore, these two antigens were not recognised by any other Ig class, either in generalized or Sowda onchocerciasis, nor were they detected by antibodies of any class present in a collection of sera representative of other nematode infections. This difference in the IgG3 response was so pronounced that Sowda sera could be distinguished from generalized onchocerciasis sera by an IgG3-specific ELISA assay with a PBS parasite extract as the antigen. Thus, a correlation has been established between one particular clinical condition of onchocerciasis (Sowda) and a serological response, defined in terms of both the parasite antigens and an immunoglobulin class restricted antibody response.</td>\n",

Although no expression of RANTES and eotaxin was seen in dermal vascular endothelial cells in biopsies taken before treatment (nor at any time in the skin of uninfected controls), endothelial expression of both eotaxin and RANTES was noted by 24 h following treatment. While RANTES expression was transient, eotaxin expression increased in parallel with increasing eosinophil recruitment up to 60 h posttreatment. These observations indicate that endothelial expression of eotaxin and RANTES may have an important role in eosinophil recruitment into the skin during helminth-killing reactions.</td>\n",

Parasite Immunol. 1996 Sep;18(9):479-82. Diethylcarbamazine (DEC) induced clearance of microfilaraemia in loiasis is associated with severe posttreatment reactions. To define the switch from hypo- to hyper-responsiveness associated with DEC treatment, phenotypic alterations of T-lymphocytes, characterized by flow cytometry, and cytokines, determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, were monitored in a microfilaraemic patient. In contrast to reports on onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariases, no elevation of interleukin (IL)-6 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha was observed. The most severe side effects coincided with an elevation of interferon (IFN)-gamma on day 3, followed by IL-10, transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta 2 and macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha (MIP-1 alpha) peaking on day 5. Phenotypically, T-cell activation markers CD38, CD54 and CD25 were significantly expressed before treatment, with high CD38 expression still existing one year after clearance of microfilaraemia. Treatment-related increases were observed with anti-CD122, anti-HLA-DR and anti-CD69. CD28 was expressed before treatment on almost 100% of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and dropped to 20% by day 5, reaching again baseline levels on day 21. Furthermore, there emerged 20% TCR alpha beta+/CD3+ T cells and 10% anti-beta V5 (c)+ T cells, altogether indicating a specific pattern of T-helper (Th) 1 and Th2 cytokines as well as expansion of certain pauciclonal T-cell populations in response to microfilarial clearance.</td>\n",

J Infect Dis. 1994 Sep;170(3):663-8. Ivermectin treatment of onchocerciasis can induce adverse reactions. Mechanisms underlying these reactions are poorly understood but may include activation of neutrophils. This study investigated the acute-phase response in onchocerciasis patients during 2 days after ivermectin treatment. The acute-phase protein C-reactive protein (CRP) and cytokines that mediate the acute-phase response (tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF alpha] and interleukin-6 [IL-6]) were measured in 144 skin snip-positive onchocerciasis patients and 12 skin snip-negative controls who received one dose of ivermectin (150 micrograms/kg). No elevated TNF alpha levels were found, but IL-6 and CRP were elevated in 25.7% and 50.7% of the patients, respectively, after ivermectin treatment. Most patients (89.2%) with raised IL-6 also had raised CRP. Such increases were not observed in controls and in patients were correlated with adverse reactions and microfilarial densities. These findings suggest a possible role of the acute-phase response in microfilarial destruction following ivermectin treatment.</td>\n",

Serum (or plasma) levels of total and mature tryptase measurements are recommended in the diagnostic evaluation of systemic anaphylaxis and systemic mastocytosis, but their interpretation must be considered in the context of a complete workup of each patient. Total tryptase levels generally reflect the increased burden of mast cells in patients with all forms of systemic mastocytosis (indolent systemic mastocytosis, smoldering systemic mastocytosis, systemic mastocytosis associated with a hematologic clonal non-mast cell disorder, aggressive systemic mastocytosis, and mast cell leukemia) and the decreased burden of mast cells associated with cytoreductive therapies in these disorders. Causes of an elevated total tryptase level other than systemic mastocytosis must be considered, however, and include systemic anaphylaxis, acute myelocytic leukemia, various myelodysplastic syndromes, hypereosinophilic syndrome associated with the FLP1L1-PDGFRA mutation, end-stage renal failure, and treatment of onchocerciasis.

The mechanisms underlying these reactions are not yet known. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether neutrophils are involved in the development of these adverse reactions. Elastase and lactoferrin, two markers for the release of neutrophil azurophilic and specific granule contents respectively, were measured by radioimmunoassays in plasma of onchocerciasis patients with varying degrees of side effects, as well as in control subjects before and 1 and 2 days after ivermectin treatment. A considerable increase of elastase levels after treatment was observed, whereas lactoferrin levels did not change. The percentage of patients with elevated elastase levels was significantly correlated with the degree of side effects.

In this study we present the immunological properties of two synthetic peptides prepared to correspond to the 1-24 and 7-24 amino acid sequence of CaR. In contrast to information previously reported for the recombinant protein, the CaR-peptide analogues appeared immunoreactive to anti-Ro/SSA autoimmune sera. Human sera from patients with SLE, Sjogren's syndrome (SS), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), as well as mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD), demonstrated a positive autoimmune response (binding of antibodies), to the CaR-peptide analogues.

Infect Immun. 1994 Sep;62(9):3696-704. RAL1 is an antigen (Ag) encoded by the filarial nematode Onchocerca volvulus, the parasite causing onchocerciasis (river blindness). RAL1 shares 64.4% identity with the autoantigen calreticulin. The striking similarity of the parasite Ag and the human autoantigen has led to the hypothesis that RAL1 may induce a cross-reactive immune response to calreticulin, which in turn may be involved in the pathogenesis of onchocerciasis. To test this hypothesis, we explored the immune response to RAL1 recombinant Ag (RAL1 rAg) and human calreticulin in patients with O. volvulus infection. A total of 86% of the O. volvulus-infected individuals produced antibodies recognizing RAL1 rAg. Antibody reactivity to RAL1 rAg in patient sera was confined primarily to the central and carboxyl-terminal parts of the molecule. No significant correlations were found to associate recognition of RAL1 rAg, or any particular portion thereof, with a particular disease state. Antibodies against RAL1 thus appear to be produced as a general immune reaction to O. volvulus infection and do not necessarily lead to a cross-reacting response with the host protein. In contrast, 33% of the patient sera tested bound recombinant human calreticulin. All of these sera also recognized a polypeptide encompassing the carboxyl-terminal portion of the RAL1 rAg. These results suggest that recognition of an epitope encoded in the carboxyl-terminal portion of RAL1 is at least in part responsible for inducing a cross-reacting immune response to the host protein.</td>\n",

Clin Exp Immunol. 1996 Aug;105(2):245-53. Chronic and generalized onchocerciasis is associated with suppression of the parasite-specific cellular responsiveness, while exposed individuals without parasitological and clinical evidence of infection (endemic normals) display prominent cellular reactivity to Onchocerca volvulus antigens (OvAg). In order to identify those parasite antigens which may account for this differential cellular responsiveness, total adult worm-derived OvAg were fractionated by means of preparative SDS-PAGE and blot-elution into 22 antigen fractions of continuously decreasing molecular weight. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from microfilariae (mf)-positive onchocerciasis patients (n = 18) proliferated weakly in response to all OvAg fractions. In contrast, in vitro reactivity of PBMC from endemic normals (n = 9) was depressed in response to OvAg of mol. wt 200-30 kD only, while antigens of mol. wt observed in response to OvAg of mol. wt 15-11 kD. Furthermore, these low mol. wt antigen fractions induced substantial production of IL-2 and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in PBMC from endemic normals, but not in those from onchocerciasis patients. Cells from individuals of both groups secreted similar amounts of IL-5 in response to all OvAg fractions, with highest production again being induced by low mol. wt OvAg. In contrast, PBMC from onchocerciasis patients clearly produced more IL-10 than did cells from endemic normals. This augmented IL-10 production by PBMC from mf-positive individuals was not only observed after stimulation with OvAg fractions, but was measured in unstimulated control cultures as well. IFN-gamma-specific mRNA in antigen-stimulated PBMC from endemic normals appeared to be more prominent than in cells from onchocerciasis patients. However, mRNA transcripts of IL-10 and IL-13 were clearly present in patients, but were absent or inconsistently observed in endemic normals. Our results suggest that vigorous Th1-type cellular responsiveness encountered in endemic normals is restricted to low mol. wt antigens of O. volvulus, while such reactivity will not be present in mf-positive individuals. Furthermore, spontaneous production of high levels of IL-10 in onchocerciasis patients is likely to suppress Th1-type immunity, and thus may favour manifestation of chronic onchocerciasis. These traits of cellular immunity may contribute to the differential outcome of O. volvulus infection, the manifestation of clinical disease, and may also regulate the build up of acquired immunity in humans.</td>\n",

Clin Exp Immunol. 1994 May;96(2):238-44. The present study examined the quantitative and qualitative changes registered in the parasite-specific antibody response, cellular reactivity and cytokine production profile in onchocerciasis patients repeatedly treated with ivermectin over a period of 8 years. The densities of Onchocerca volvulus microfilariae (mf) in treated patients remained significantly reduced, whereas the number of permanently amicrofilaridermic patients (subclinical infection) increased with repeated treatments. In vitro cellular responses to O. volvulus antigen (OvAg) were highest (P volvulus (endemic normals). Cellular reactivity in repeatedly treated patients was higher at 84 than at 36 months post initial treatment (p.i.t); furthermore, the proliferative responses to OvAg, mycobacterial purified protein derivative (PPD) and streptococcal SL-O were greater (P onchocerciasis patients. In amicrofilaridermic patients such reactivity approached the magnitude observed in endemic normals. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from patients and endemic normals produced equivalent amounts of IL-2, IL-4 and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in response to mitogenic stimulation with phytohaemagglutinin (PHA); in response to OvAg, however, significantly more IL-2 and IFN-gamma were produced by PBMC from subclinical amicrofilaridermic patients or endemic normals than by mf-positive patients. OvAg-specific production of IL-4 by PBMC from treated patients was lower at 84 than at 36 months p.i.t. At three months p.i.t. the titres of circulating OvAg-specific IgG1-3 had increased (P declined with repeated treatments. Only IgG1 and IgG4 bound to OvAg of mol. wt 2-12 kD at 1 month p.i.t., while recognition of OvAg of mol. wt 10-200 kD by IgG1, IgG2 and IgG4 reached a maximum intensity at 3-6 months p.i.t., with the overall intensity of binding to OvAg gradually weakening thereafter. These results suggest that onchocerciasis-associated immunosuppression is reversible following ivermectin-induced permanent clearance of microfilariae from the skin; and that a vigorous parasite-specific cellular reactivity and a sustained production of IL-2 and IFN-gamma in amicrofilaridermic individuals may contribute to controlling O. volvulus infection.</td>\n",

Clin Exp Immunol. 2007 Mar;147(3):504-12. The recommended control option against onchocerciasis is repeated ivermectin treatment, which will need to be implemented for decades, and it remains unknown how repeated ivermectin therapy might affect immunity against Onchocerca volvulus in the long term. O. volvulus-specific antibody reactivity and cellular cytokine production were investigated in onchocerciasis patients receiving ivermectin (150 microg/kg) annually for 16 years. In treated patients, the T helper type 2 (Th2) cytokine interleukin (IL)-5 and T regulatory IL-10 in response to O. volvulus antigen (OvAg) and bacteria-derived Streptolysin O (SL-O) diminished to levels found in infection-free endemic controls; also, cellular release of Th1-type interferon (IFN)-gamma at 16 years post initial ivermectin treatment (p.i.t.) approached control levels. In ivermectin-treated onchocerciasis patients, IL-5 production in responses to the mitogen phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) decreased, but IL-10 in response PHA increased, and neither attained the cytokine production levels of endemic controls. At 16 years p.i.t., O. volvulus-specific IgG1 and IgG4 subclass reactivity still persisted at higher levels in onchocerciasis patients than in O. volvulus exposed but microfilariae-free endemic controls. In addition, cytokine responses remained depressed in onchocerciasis patients infected concurrently with Mansonella perstans and Necator americanus or Entamoeba histolytica/dispar. Thus, long-term ivermectin therapy of onchocerciasis may not suffice to re-establish fully a balanced Th1 and Th2 immune responsiveness in O. volvulus microfilariae-negative individuals. Such deficient reconstitution of immune competence may be due to an as yet continuing and uncontrolled reinfection with O. volvulus, but parasite co-infections can also bias and may prevent the development of such immunity.</td>\n",

The proliferative, cytokine, and antibody response to TT of O. volvulus-infected subjects (n = 19) and comparable noninfected controls (n = 20) were studied before and 6 months after vaccination with TT. Following vaccination, antibody levels, proliferative responses, and levels of interferon-gamma were significantly greater in noninfected subjects (P produced interleukin-10, but noninfected controls did not (P volvulus can diminish the immune response to an unrelated antigen (TT) by a mechanism that is likely to involve interleukin-10.</td>\n",

Clin Exp Immunol. 1996 Aug;105(2):245-53. Chronic and generalized onchocerciasis is associated with suppression of the parasite-specific cellular responsiveness, while exposed individuals without parasitological and clinical evidence of infection (endemic normals) display prominent cellular reactivity to Onchocerca volvulus antigens (OvAg). In order to identify those parasite antigens which may account for this differential cellular responsiveness, total adult worm-derived OvAg were fractionated by means of preparative SDS-PAGE and blot-elution into 22 antigen fractions of continuously decreasing molecular weight. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from microfilariae (mf)-positive onchocerciasis patients (n = 18) proliferated weakly in response to all OvAg fractions. In contrast, in vitro reactivity of PBMC from endemic normals (n = 9) was depressed in response to OvAg of mol. wt 200-30 kD only, while antigens of mol. wt observed in response to OvAg of mol. wt 15-11 kD. Furthermore, these low mol. wt antigen fractions induced substantial production of IL-2 and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in PBMC from endemic normals, but not in those from onchocerciasis patients. Cells from individuals of both groups secreted similar amounts of IL-5 in response to all OvAg fractions, with highest production again being induced by low mol. wt OvAg. In contrast, PBMC from onchocerciasis patients clearly produced more IL-10 than did cells from endemic normals. This augmented IL-10 production by PBMC from mf-positive individuals was not only observed after stimulation with OvAg fractions, but was measured in unstimulated control cultures as well. IFN-gamma-specific mRNA in antigen-stimulated PBMC from endemic normals appeared to be more prominent than in cells from onchocerciasis patients. However, mRNA transcripts of IL-10 and IL-13 were clearly present in patients, but were absent or inconsistently observed in endemic normals. Our results suggest that vigorous Th1-type cellular responsiveness encountered in endemic normals is restricted to low mol. wt antigens of O. volvulus, while such reactivity will not be present in mf-positive individuals. Furthermore, spontaneous production of high levels of IL-10 in onchocerciasis patients is likely to suppress Th1-type immunity, and thus may favour manifestation of chronic onchocerciasis. These traits of cellular immunity may contribute to the differential outcome of O. volvulus infection, the manifestation of clinical disease, and may also regulate the build up of acquired immunity in humans.</td>\n",

Immunology. 1999 Nov;98(3):406-12. Infection of mice with microfilariae of Onchocerca lienalis induces high levels of protective immunity to reinfection, which is dependent on interleukin (IL)-5 but not IL-4. Here, we have investigated the effect of exogenous IL-12 administration during either the priming or effector phases of the immune response. When administered during priming, IL-12 induced down-regulation of parasite-specific serum immunoglobulin (Ig) E and up-regulation of IgG2a. Antigen-specific IL-4 responses were strongly suppressed, whilst blood eosinophil levels were partially reduced. When administered during a challenge infection, IL-12 did not significantly influence the balance of antibody isotypes, but partially reduced eosinophil production. Antigen-specific IL-4 responses were again completely ablated. Unusually, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) responses were not significantly affected following IL-12 administration, either during priming or after challenge infections. Moreover, despite a fall in antigen-specific IL-5 production, the expression of IL-5-dependent immunity, as determined by reduction in worm recoveries, was fully maintained. These data demonstrate that parasite-induced IL-4 can be abrogated without affecting protective immunity to Onchocerca microfilariae in mice. In view of the established role of IL-4 in pathogenesis, this may have important implications for the development of immunoprophylaxis aimed at microfilariae and the alleviation of pathology in onchocerciasis.</td>\n",

Am J Trop Med Hyg. 1996 May;54(5):490-7. An Onchocerca volvulus expression library was differentially screened to identify a molecular marker distinguishing sowda (lichenified onchodermatitis) from other onchocerciasis forms. One clone, PG3, was recognized by pooled sera from patients with sowda, but not by pooled sera from patients with generalized onchocerciasis; it was not recognized by sera from patients with lymphatic filariasis or other helminth infections. The DNA of PG3 hybridized strongly with O. volvulus Eco RI-digested DNA, but not with DNA from Brugia spp., Trichinella spp., and humans. A weak reaction was observed with DNA from O. gibsoni and Acanthocheilonema viteae. The PG3 DNA sequence showed a high homology with both human and nematode collagens. Confirmation of the collagen-like nature of the sowda-specific PG3 product was obtained by amino terminal sequencing of the PG3 expression product, as well as by demonstrating its susceptibility to collagenase digestion. The characteristic recognition of the O. volvulus collagen specified by clone PG3 was confirmed by measuring antibody levels to the expressed product in individual sowda and generalized onchocerciasis sera, respectively. Identification of a nematode collagen antigen mainly recognized in sowda patients raises the possibility that this extreme form of dermatitis might arise through cross-reactivity between anti-O. volvulus collagen antibodies and human collagen. However, a relationship between the PG3 recognition by antibodies and the sowda pathogenesis could not be demonstrated.</td>\n",

Mechanisms underlying these reactions are poorly understood but may include activation of neutrophils. This study investigated the acute-phase response in onchocerciasis patients during 2 days after ivermectin treatment. The acute-phase protein C-reactive protein (CRP) and cytokines that mediate the acute-phase response (tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF alpha] and interleukin-6 [IL-6]) were measured in 144 skin snip-positive onchocerciasis patients and 12 skin snip-negative controls who received one dose of ivermectin (150 micrograms/kg). No elevated TNF alpha levels were found, but IL-6 and CRP were elevated in 25.7% and 50.7% of the patients, respectively, after ivermectin treatment. Most patients (89.2%) with raised IL-6 also had raised CRP. Such increases were not observed in controls and in patients were correlated with adverse reactions and microfilarial densities.

Clin Immunol. 2000 Apr;95(1 Pt 1):51-61. The roles of eotaxin, RANTES, and MCP-3 expression in eosinophil recruitment to the site of parasite killing that occurs following ivermectin treatment of onchocerciasis were assessed in the skin of 13 Onchocerca volvulus-infected subjects and two noninfected controls before and after ivermectin treatment. Adverse reactions in infected subjects were associated with the appearance of eosinophils in the dermis as part of a perivascular inflammatory infiltrate. Although no expression of RANTES and eotaxin was seen in dermal vascular endothelial cells in biopsies taken before treatment (nor at any time in the skin of uninfected controls), endothelial expression of both eotaxin and RANTES was noted by 24 h following treatment. While RANTES expression was transient, eotaxin expression increased in parallel with increasing eosinophil recruitment up to 60 h posttreatment. These observations indicate that endothelial expression of eotaxin and RANTES may have an important role in eosinophil recruitment into the skin during helminth-killing reactions.</td>\n",

Trop Med Parasitol. 1992 Mar;43(1):47-53. Monoclonal antibodies, reactive with antigens solubilised from the body wall of intact female Onchocerca volvulus using 2% 2-beta-mercaptoethanol, have been characterised. Two IgG1 antibodies, Cam1 and Cam28, recognised antigens of apparent molecular weights of 18,000 and 28,000; and 120,000, respectively. The target antigens of Cam1 and Cam28 could be localised in the cuticle. Inhibition ELISAs showed that target epitopes of both monoclonal antibodies induce an antibody response in onchocerciasis patients. 153 sera from Sierra Leonean patients were tested for their individual antibody levels against antigen epitopes recognised by Cam1 and Cam28. Patients within the age of 5-8 years had the highest levels of antibodies against the Cam28-epitope, whereas patients above 60 years had almost none. Amicrofilaremic patients had higher anti-Cam28 antibody levels than microfilaremic patients and there was a significant difference between groups with no chronic skin disease and those with mild or severe signs. A high percentage of patients (80.4%) recognised the Cam1-epitope, highest antibody levels being found in patients within the age group of 15 to 45 years and in microfilaremic patients. However, levels of antibodies inhibiting monoclonal antibody Cam1 could not be correlated with presence or absence of skin disease.</td>\n",

Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1999 Oct 12;96(21):11928-33. Hereditary tyrosinemia type I and alkaptonuria are disorders of tyrosine catabolism caused by deficiency of fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH) and homogentisic acid dioxygenase (HGD), respectively. Tyrosinemia is a severe childhood disease that affects the liver and kidneys, but alkaptonuria is a more benign adult disorder in comparison. Because HGD is upstream of FAH in the tyrosine pathway, mice doubly mutant in both enzymes were found to be protected from the liver and renal damage of tyrosinemia as hypothesized. Mice mutant at the tyrosinemic locus but heterozygous for alkaptonuria spontaneously developed clonal nodules of functionally normal hepatocytes that were able to rescue the livers of some mice with this genotype. This phenotypic rescue was a result of an inactivating mutation of the wild-type homogentisic acid dioxygenase gene, thus presenting an example of an in vivo suppressor mutation in a mammalian model.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "1    Suwannarat P, O'Brien K, Perry MB, Sebring N, Bernardini I, Kaiser-Kupfer MI, Rubin BI, Tsilou E, Gerber LH, Gahl WA: Use of nitisinone in patients with alkaptonuria. Metabolism. 2005 Jun;54(6):719-28. Alkaptonuria, a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the HGD gene and deficiency of homogentisate 1,2 dioxygenase, is characterized by ochronosis, arthritis, and daily excretion of gram quantities of homogentisic acid (HGA). Nitisinone, an inhibitor of the enzyme 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase, can drastically reduce urinary excretion of HGA in individuals with alkaptonuria. We investigated the safety and the HGA-depleting efficacy of nitisinone in an open-label, single-center study of 9 alkaptonuria patients (5 women, 4 men; 35-69 years of age) over the course of 3 to 4 months. Each patient received nitisinone in incremental doses, 0.35 mg bid followed by 1.05 mg bid, and remained on this dosage and a regular diet for 3 months. Nitisinone reduced urinary HGA levels from an average of 4.0 +/- 1.8 (SD) g/day to 0.2 +/- 0.2 g/day ( P tyrosine concentration, initially 68 +/- 18 mmicro mol/L, rose to 760 +/- 181 micro mol/L ( P protein-restricted diet (40 g/day), and their mean plasma tyrosine level fell from 755 +/- 167 to 603 +/- 114 mu mol/L. Six of the 7 patients who received nitisinone for more than 1 week reported decreased pain in their affected joints. Weekly ophthalmologic examinations showed no signs of corneal toxicity. Adverse events included the passing of kidney stones, the recognition of symptoms related to aortic stenosis, and elevation of liver transaminase levels. We conclude that low-dose nitisinone effectively reduced urinary HGA levels in patients with alkaptonuria. Future long-term clinical trials are planned to determine the benefits of nitisinone in preventing joint deterioration and providing pain relief, and its long-term side effects.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

Study of urinary homogentisic acid and a determinantion of group HLA were carried out for 36 members of a family spread over three generations with three cases of ochronotic rheumatism in the second generation. Alkaptonuria was discovered in seven other subjects, six of them members of the third generation: urinary elimination was poor, less than 0.60 g/24 hours. There is a certain degree of consanguinity in the family studied here and these findings do not therefore rule out a recessive autosomal transmission of the alkaptonuria. They do however lead to the consideration that alkaptonuria may sometimes be found in heterozygotic subjects. A genetic relationship between HLA complex and alkaptonuria can only be claimed with difficulty from this familial study, but the high frequency of B 27 antigen (29 out of 36 members carring it) leaves room for the hypothesis that the B 27 gene, or more precisely a gene associated with the B 27 gene, plays a part in the development of ochronotic rheumatism.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

Ascorbic acid treatment monitored by urinary HGA excretion. Patients with alkaptonuria lack homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase leading to retention of homogentistic acid (HGA) in body fluids and eventually to tissue deposition of oxidation products, giving rise to the clinical picture of ochronosis. Ascorbic acid is a known inhibitor of the enzyme which catalyses the oxidation of homogentisic acid (HGA) to the polymer with affinity for collagen and was used in the treatment of three siblings with alkaptonuria. Ascorbic acid 500 mg bid was administered for 12 months. Two of the siblings tolerated the treatment, and in one the symptoms improved, whereas in the other they worsened. Plasma and urinary levels of HGA were monitored with a new HPLC method. Ascorbic acid is not effective in the treatment of symptomatic ochronosis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

J Exp Med. 2005 Nov 21;202(10):1327-32. The bacterial pathogens of the genus Yersinia, the causative agents of plague, septicemia, and gastrointestinal syndromes, use a type III secretion system to inject virulence factors into host target cells. One virulence factor, YopJ, is essential for the death of infected macrophages and can block host proinflammatory responses by inhibiting both the nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, which might be important for evasion of the host immune response and aid in establishing a systemic infection. Here, we show that YopJ is a promiscuous deubiquitinating enzyme that negatively regulates signaling by removing ubiquitin moieties from critical proteins, such as TRAF2, TRAF6, and IkappaBalpha. In contrast to the cylindromatosis tumor suppressor CYLD, which attenuates NF-kappaB signaling by selectively removing K63-linked polyubiquitin chains that activate IkappaB kinase, YopJ also cleaves K48-linked chains and thereby inhibits proteasomal degradation of IkappaBalpha. YopJ, but not a catalytically inactive YopJ mutant, promoted deubiquitination of cellular proteins and cleaved both K48- and K63-linked polyubiquitin. Moreover, an in vitro assay was established to demonstrate directly the deubiquitinating activity of purified YopJ.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "7    Kovalenko A, Chable-Bessia C, Cantarella G, Israel A, Wallach D, Courtois G: The tumour suppressor CYLD negatively regulates NF-kappaB signalling by deubiquitination. Nature. 2003 Aug 14;424(6950):801-5. NF-kappaB transcription factors have key roles in inflammation, immune response, oncogenesis and protection against apoptosis. In most cells, these factors are kept inactive in the cytoplasm through association with IkappaB inhibitors. After stimulation by various reagents, IkappaB is phosphorylated by the IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex and degraded by the proteasome, allowing NF-kappaB to translocate to the nucleus and activate its target genes. Here we report that CYLD, a tumour suppressor that is mutated in familial cylindromatosis, interacts with NEMO, the regulatory subunit of IKK. CYLD also interacts directly with tumour-necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)-associated factor 2 (TRAF2), an adaptor molecule involved in signalling by members of the family of TNF/nerve growth factor receptors. CYLD has deubiquitinating activity that is directed towards non-K48-linked polyubiquitin chains, and negatively modulates TRAF-mediated activation of IKK, strengthening the notion that ubiquitination is involved in IKK activation by TRAFs and suggesting that CYLD functions in this process. Truncations of CYLD found in cylindromatosis result in reduced enzymatic activity, indicating a link between impaired deubiquitination of CYLD substrates and human pathophysiology.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

Moreover, an in vitro assay was established to demonstrate directly the deubiquitinating activity of purified YopJ.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

Epub 2007 May 10. Mutations in the cylindromatosis (CYLD) gene cause benign tumors of skin appendages, referred to as cylindromas. The CYLD gene encodes a deubiquitinating enzyme that removes Lys-63-linked ubiquitin chains from I kappa B kinase signaling components and thereby inhibits NF-kappaB pathway activation. The dysregulation of NF-kappaB activity has been proposed to promote cell transformation in part by increasing apoptosis resistance, but it is not clear whether this is CYLD's only or predominant tumor-suppressing function. Here, we show that CYLD is also required for timely entry into mitosis. Consistent with a cell-cycle regulatory function, CYLD localizes to microtubules in interphase and the midbody during telophase, and its protein levels decrease as cells exit from mitosis. We identified the protein kinase Plk1 as a potential target of CYLD in the regulation of mitotic entry, based on their physical interaction and similar loss-of-function and overexpression phenotypes. Our findings raise the possibility that, as with other genes regulating tumorigenesis, CYLD has not only tumor-suppressing (apoptosis regulation) but also tumor-promoting activities (enhancer of mitotic entry). We propose that this additional function of CYLD could provide an explanation for the benign nature of most cylindroma lesions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "17   Wall NR, Shi Y: Small RNA: can RNA interference be exploited for therapy? . Lancet. 2003 Oct 25;362(9393):1401-3. CONTEXT: RNA interference (RNAi) is the sequence-specific gene-silencing induced by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), and gives information about gene function quickly, easily, and inexpensively. The use of RNAi for genetic-based therapies is widely studied, especially in viral infections, cancers, and inherited genetic disorders. RNAi has been used to make tissue-specific knockdown mice for studying gene function in a whole animal. Combined with genomics data, RNAi-directed gene-silencing could allow functional determination of any gene expressed in a cell or pathway. The term RNAi came from the discovery that the injection of dsRNAs into Caenorhabditis elegans interferes with the expression of specific genes containing a complementary region to the delivered dsRNA. Although stalled for a time by the non-gene-specific interferon response elicited by dsRNA molecules longer than about 30 nucleotides in mammalian cells, Tom Tuschl's group found that transfection of synthetic 21-nucleotide small-interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes were highly selective and sequence-specific inhibitors of endogenous genes. STARTING POINT: siRNA expression has been studied with siRNA from plasmid and viral vectors that efficiently deliver siRNAs into both dividing and non-dividing cells, stem cells, zygotes, and their differentiated progeny. A collection of RNA interference vectors that suppress 50 human de-ubiquitinating enzymes allowed Thijn Brummelkamp and colleagues to study this gene family and to identify de-ubiquitinating enzymes in cancer-relevant pathways (Nature 2003; 424: 797-801). These researchers found that the familial cylindromatosis tumour suppressor gene (CYLD), previously of unknown function, could enhance the activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB, leading to increased resistance to apoptosis. They have now started to investigate the use of CYLD inhibitors in clinical trials. WHERE NEXT: The ability to efficiently and stably produce and deliver sufficient amounts of siRNA to the proper target tissues require refinement before this new technology can be tried clinically. Initial in-vivo studies reported effective transgene suppression in adult mice by chemically synthesised siRNAs. More recently many researchers have used plasmid and viral vectors for transcription of short-hairpin RNAs, both in vitro and in vivo. With these expression systems, gene expression was more stably inhibited than with the transient knockdown recorded with chemically synthesised siRNA. Human trials exploiting these latest findings are likely to soon follow.                                                                                                                                           \n",

Nature. 2003 Aug 14;424(6950):801-5. NF-kappaB transcription factors have key roles in inflammation, immune response, oncogenesis and protection against apoptosis. In most cells, these factors are kept inactive in the cytoplasm through association with IkappaB inhibitors. After stimulation by various reagents, IkappaB is phosphorylated by the IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex and degraded by the proteasome, allowing NF-kappaB to translocate to the nucleus and activate its target genes. Here we report that CYLD, a tumour suppressor that is mutated in familial cylindromatosis, interacts with NEMO, the regulatory subunit of IKK. CYLD also interacts directly with tumour-necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)-associated factor 2 (TRAF2), an adaptor molecule involved in signalling by members of the family of TNF/nerve growth factor receptors. CYLD has deubiquitinating activity that is directed towards non-K48-linked polyubiquitin chains, and negatively modulates TRAF-mediated activation of IKK, strengthening the notion that ubiquitination is involved in IKK activation by TRAFs and suggesting that CYLD functions in this process. Truncations of CYLD found in cylindromatosis result in reduced enzymatic activity, indicating a link between impaired deubiquitination of CYLD substrates and human pathophysiology.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

Protein modification by the conjugation of ubiquitin moieties--ubiquitination--plays a major part in many biological processes, including cell cycle and apoptosis. The enzymes that mediate ubiquitin-conjugation have been well-studied, but much less is known about the ubiquitin-specific proteases that mediate de-ubiquitination of cellular substrates. To study this gene family, we designed a collection of RNA interference vectors to suppress 50 human de-ubiquitinating enzymes, and used these vectors to identify de-ubiquitinating enzymes in cancer-relevant pathways. We report here that inhibition of one of these enzymes, the familial cylindromatosis tumour suppressor gene (CYLD), having no known function, enhances activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB. We show that CYLD binds to the NEMO (also known as IKKgamma) component of the IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex, and appears to regulate its activity through de-ubiquitination of TRAF2, as TRAF2 ubiquitination can be modulated by CYLD. Inhibition of CYLD increases resistance to apoptosis, suggesting a mechanism through which loss of CYLD contributes to oncogenesis. We show that this effect can be relieved by aspirin derivatives that inhibit NF-kappaB activity, which suggests a therapeutic intervention strategy to restore growth control in patients suffering from familial cylindromatosis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

Nature. 2003 Aug 14;424(6950):793-6. Familial cylindromatosis is an autosomal dominant predisposition to tumours of skin appendages called cylindromas. Familial cylindromatosis is caused by mutations in a gene encoding the CYLD protein of previously unknown function. Here we show that CYLD is a deubiquitinating enzyme that negatively regulates activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB by specific tumour-necrosis factor receptors (TNFRs). Loss of the deubiquitinating activity of CYLD correlates with tumorigenesis. CYLD inhibits activation of NF-kappaB by the TNFR family members CD40, XEDAR and EDAR in a manner that depends on the deubiquitinating activity of CYLD. Downregulation of CYLD by RNA-mediated interference augments both basal and CD40-mediated activation of NF-kappaB. The inhibition of NF-kappaB activation by CYLD is mediated, at least in part, by the deubiquitination and inactivation of TNFR-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) and, to a lesser extent, TRAF6. These results indicate that CYLD is a negative regulator of the cytokine-mediated activation of NF-kappaB that is required for appropriate cellular homeostasis of skin appendages.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "23   Zhou H, Monack DM, Kayagaki N, Wertz I, Yin J, Wolf B, Dixit VM: Yersinia virulence factor YopJ acts as a deubiquitinase to inhibit NF-kappa B activation. J Exp Med. 2005 Nov 21;202(10):1327-32. The bacterial pathogens of the genus Yersinia, the causative agents of plague, septicemia, and gastrointestinal syndromes, use a type III secretion system to inject virulence factors into host target cells. One virulence factor, YopJ, is essential for the death of infected macrophages and can block host proinflammatory responses by inhibiting both the nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, which might be important for evasion of the host immune response and aid in establishing a systemic infection. Here, we show that YopJ is a promiscuous deubiquitinating enzyme that negatively regulates signaling by removing ubiquitin moieties from critical proteins, such as TRAF2, TRAF6, and IkappaBalpha. In contrast to the cylindromatosis tumor suppressor CYLD, which attenuates NF-kappaB signaling by selectively removing K63-linked polyubiquitin chains that activate IkappaB kinase, YopJ also cleaves K48-linked chains and thereby inhibits proteasomal degradation of IkappaBalpha. YopJ, but not a catalytically inactive YopJ mutant, promoted deubiquitination of cellular proteins and cleaved both K48- and K63-linked polyubiquitin. Moreover, an in vitro assay was established to demonstrate directly the deubiquitinating activity of purified YopJ.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "27   Kovalenko A, Chable-Bessia C, Cantarella G, Israel A, Wallach D, Courtois G: The tumour suppressor CYLD negatively regulates NF-kappaB signalling by deubiquitination. Nature. 2003 Aug 14;424(6950):801-5. NF-kappaB transcription factors have key roles in inflammation, immune response, oncogenesis and protection against apoptosis. In most cells, these factors are kept inactive in the cytoplasm through association with IkappaB inhibitors. After stimulation by various reagents, IkappaB is phosphorylated by the IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex and degraded by the proteasome, allowing NF-kappaB to translocate to the nucleus and activate its target genes. Here we report that CYLD, a tumour suppressor that is mutated in familial cylindromatosis, interacts with NEMO, the regulatory subunit of IKK. CYLD also interacts directly with tumour-necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)-associated factor 2 (TRAF2), an adaptor molecule involved in signalling by members of the family of TNF/nerve growth factor receptors. CYLD has deubiquitinating activity that is directed towards non-K48-linked polyubiquitin chains, and negatively modulates TRAF-mediated activation of IKK, strengthening the notion that ubiquitination is involved in IKK activation by TRAFs and suggesting that CYLD functions in this process. Truncations of CYLD found in cylindromatosis result in reduced enzymatic activity, indicating a link between impaired deubiquitination of CYLD substrates and human pathophysiology.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

Pharmacogenomics J. 2006 May-Jun;6(3):211-9. Retigabine (RGB) is an investigational antiepileptic drug, which undergoes extensive UGT1A1, 1A9 and 1A4-mediated N-glucuronidation and N-acetylation. The mono-acetylated metabolite of RGB has some pharmacological activity and is denoted AWD21-360. We investigated whether the pharmacokinetics (PK) of RGB and AWD21-360 are altered in subjects with Gilbert's syndrome (GS) and/or with frequent N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) slow acetylator (SA) polymorphisms. Based on consistent genotyping and phenotyping screening results, 37 Caucasian subjects (21-46 years; 31 men, six women) were assigned to one of the following groups: (1) absence of GS (non-GS)/rapid acetylator (RA) (N=11); (2) GS/RA (N=8); (3) non-GS/SA (N=11); (4) GS/SA (N=7). Subjects received single and multiple (b.i.d.) 200-mg oral RGB doses over 5 days. Blood samples were collected up to 60 h after dosing for plasma PK of RGB and AWD21-360. Group comparisons were performed by ANOVA. Single-dose PK of RGB and AWD21-360 and multiple-dose PK of RGB did not differ significantly between groups. After multiple dose treatment, RA subjects showed a significantly higher total exposure to AWD21-360 of about 32% (95% CI 101.9-172.5) relative to SA subjects (P=0.0362). The UGT1A1 metabolic capacity (i.e. presence or absence of GS), however, did not significantly affect the overall exposure to AWD21-360. The results indicate that the PK of RGB is unaltered in individuals with GS, in subjects with NAT2 SA status, and in carriers of both variants, whereas the total exposure to AWD21-360 is significantly related to the RA or SA status of subjects. Results further suggest that metabolic switching to the mono-acetylated metabolite AWD21-360 may partially compensate for the impaired glucuronidation capacity in GS subjects.

Gilbert's syndrome is a benign, often familial condition characterized by asymptomatic jaundice. A patient suffering from Gilbert's syndrome may have hepatic activity of bilirubin-UDP-glucuronosyltransferase decreasing to levels around 30% of the normal. A clinical diagnosis of Gilbert's syndrome is usually followed in case of mild hyperbilirubinemia with a high fraction of unconjugated bilirubin, normal values of liver enzymes, and no overt signs of hemolysis. This article reported a 17-year-old male with only partial indication of indirect hyperbilirubinemia. Rifampicin test and caloric restriction test were applied to assure the patient had Gilbert's syndrome. These two non-invasive diagnostic means, with the benefit of avoiding hazardous liver biopsy, are gaining popularity in our routine Gilbert's syndrome examination.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

J Lab Clin Med. 1981 Jul;98(1):37-45. Implications for the diagnosis of Gilbert's syndrome. BRT and CBR were determined from studies of radiobilirubin kinetics in 14 patients undergoing splenectomy for hereditary spherocytosis. Studies were conducted both before and after the operation in order to assess the effects of the postsplenectomy fall in BRT on CBR. Splenectomy led to a doubling of the RBC-t1/2 from 13.0 +/- 1.7 (S.E.) days to 26.1 +/- 1.5 and a fall in BRT from 15.9 +/- 4.4 mg/kg/day to 4.3 +/- 0.9. In seven patients (group A) initially normal values for CBR were unaltered by surgery. In the remaining seven (group B), low preoperative values for CBR, suggestive of Gilbert's syndrome, uniformly improved after splenectomy, becoming normal in five patients. Nevertheless, family studies and reduced values for UDPGT activity supported the initial impression of concomitant Gilbert's syndrome in group B. These studies suggest the existence of a latent state for Gilbert's syndrome that, in some patients, may be unmasked by a hemolytic stress. As such, they have important implications for both pedigree analysis and incidence studies of this condition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

Gilbert's syndrome is an inherited disorder which is characterised by unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia. In patients with Gilbert's syndrome, both bilirubin clearance and in vitro hepatic microsomal uridine diphosphoglucuronyl transferase (UDPGT) activity are reduced. In addition, there is evidence suggesting impaired hepatic uptake of bilirubin in Gilbert's syndrome. Glucuronidation of a number of substrates appears to be impaired in Gilbert's syndrome, but the significance of the reported changes in oxidation and acetylation are less clear.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

J Pediatr. 2000 Apr;136(4):556-9. The molecular basis for the considerable variation of serum bilirubin levels and the incidence of gallstone formation in patients with congenital dyserythropoietic anemia (CDA) type II are unknown. We show that the combined effect of an increased bilirubin load caused by dyserythropoiesis in CDA II and decreased bilirubin conjugation caused by reduced expression of uridine diphosphate glucuronosyl transferase (UGT1A) would increase the risk of hyperbilirubinemia (P gallstone formation (chi (2): P gallstone formation in patients with CDA II is 4. 75-fold the rate of patients without Gilbert's syndrome, and gallstone diagnosis occurs at a younger age (P CDA II.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

Biopharm Drug Dispos. 1993 Oct;14(7):567-78. The glutathione (GSH) S-transferases are believed to have dual functions as hepatic detoxifying enzymes and intrahepatic binding proteins. Little is known about their alterations in human liver diseases. Therefore, we have studied the relationship between the enzyme activity and rose bengal (RB) binding in hepatic cytosol and plasma indocyanine green (ICG) kinetics in patients with various liver diseases. The enzyme activity was measured in samples of hepatic cytosol obtained from 52 patients. In addition, the content of cationic and neutral transferases was estimated in 17 biopsy samples by densitometry of Coomassie blue stained sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoretograms. RB binding studies also were performed on cytosol samples. ICG kinetic parameters were determined using the two-compartment open model in 17 patients who were given the dye (0.5 mg kg-1) intravenously. Correlations between the enzyme activity and liver function tests, content of the enzyme, RB binding and ICG kinetic parameters were evaluated. The following results were obtained. (1) The enzyme activities were high in alcoholic liver disease, fatty liver and Gilbert's syndrome, and low in cirrhosis. (2) The enzyme activities were positively correlated with serum cholinesterase activity, serum albumin level and hepaplastin test, and negatively correlated with ICG retention rate at 15 min.

Biopharm Drug Dispos. 1993 Oct;14(7):567-78. The glutathione (GSH) S-transferases are believed to have dual functions as hepatic detoxifying enzymes and intrahepatic binding proteins. Little is known about their alterations in human liver diseases. Therefore, we have studied the relationship between the enzyme activity and rose bengal (RB) binding in hepatic cytosol and plasma indocyanine green (ICG) kinetics in patients with various liver diseases. The enzyme activity was measured in samples of hepatic cytosol obtained from 52 patients. In addition, the content of cationic and neutral transferases was estimated in 17 biopsy samples by densitometry of Coomassie blue stained sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoretograms. RB binding studies also were performed on cytosol samples. ICG kinetic parameters were determined using the two-compartment open model in 17 patients who were given the dye (0.5 mg kg-1) intravenously. Correlations between the enzyme activity and liver function tests, content of the enzyme, RB binding and ICG kinetic parameters were evaluated. The following results were obtained. (1) The enzyme activities were high in alcoholic liver disease, fatty liver and Gilbert's syndrome, and low in cirrhosis. (2) The enzyme activities were positively correlated with serum cholinesterase activity, serum albumin level and hepaplastin test, and negatively correlated with ICG retention rate at 15 min. (3) The enzyme activity, its content and RB binding affinity of the cytosol were positively correlated with each other. (4) The enzyme activity was positively correlated with hepatic ICG distribution volume. These results are consistent with the role of the GSH S-transferases as ligandins in intracellular storage of dyes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2002 Jan-Feb;19(1):39-44. The case of an 8-year-old male child with severe kernicterus sequelae is presented in this paper. The child's hemoglobin value varied between 6.0 and 10.8 g/dL and his reticulocyte count ranged between 3.4 and 46.0% during the steady-state condition and hyperhemolytic crisis, respectively. A chronic hemolytic type of red cell G6PD deficiency was diagnosed. DNA studies indicate that the mutation was G6PD Guadalajara 1159 C --> T (387 Arg --> Cys) that is situated at the NADP binding site. Additionally, extra nucleotides of (TA) in the A (TA) n TAA motif of the promoter region of the uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase gene (UGT-1 A) were found to be homozygous in the patient. The coexistence of Gilbert syndrome with a chronic type of G6PD deficiency was suggested as a cause of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia leading to kernicterus.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

AIMS: To verify that Gilbert's syndrome, which is caused by decreased glucuronidation capacity of the UDP-glucuronosyl transferase (UGT) 1A1, does not account for impaired morphine clearance. METHODS: Noncompartmental pharmacokinetic parameters for morphine and its glucuronide metabolites were compared between five carriers of Gilbert's syndrome and six noncarriers after a 7.5 mg (19.8 micro mol) intravenous injection of morphine sulphate pentahydrate. To estimate the amount of morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G) formed from morphine, 1 mg of deuterized M6G was injected intravenously at the same time. RESULTS: No differences were detected between carriers and noncarriers of Gilbert's syndrome in the clearance of morphine (80.1 +/- 12 l h (-1) vs 87.9 +/- 22 l h (-1)) and in the percentage of morphine that was metabolized to M6G (10.9 +/- 1.4 vs 13 +/- 2). The areas under the plasma concentration vs time curves of morphine, M6G and morphine-3-glucuronide also did not differ between carriers and noncarriers of Gilbert's syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Gilbert's syndrome is not a factor to be considered when prescribing morphine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

Pharmacogenomics J. 2006 May-Jun;6(3):211-9. Retigabine (RGB) is an investigational antiepileptic drug, which undergoes extensive UGT1A1, 1A9 and 1A4-mediated N-glucuronidation and N-acetylation. The mono-acetylated metabolite of RGB has some pharmacological activity and is denoted AWD21-360. We investigated whether the pharmacokinetics (PK) of RGB and AWD21-360 are altered in subjects with Gilbert's syndrome (GS) and/or with frequent N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) slow acetylator (SA) polymorphisms. Based on consistent genotyping and phenotyping screening results, 37 Caucasian subjects (21-46 years; 31 men, six women) were assigned to one of the following groups: (1) absence of GS (non-GS)/rapid acetylator (RA) (N=11); (2) GS/RA (N=8); (3) non-GS/SA (N=11); (4) GS/SA (N=7). Subjects received single and multiple (b.i.d.) 200-mg oral RGB doses over 5 days. Blood samples were collected up to 60 h after dosing for plasma PK of RGB and AWD21-360. Group comparisons were performed by ANOVA. Single-dose PK of RGB and AWD21-360 and multiple-dose PK of RGB did not differ significantly between groups. After multiple dose treatment, RA subjects showed a significantly higher total exposure to AWD21-360 of about 32% (95% CI 101.9-172.5) relative to SA subjects (P=0.0362). The UGT1A1 metabolic capacity (i.e. presence or absence of GS), however, did not significantly affect the overall exposure to AWD21-360. The results indicate that the PK of RGB is unaltered in individuals with GS, in subjects with NAT2 SA status, and in carriers of both variants, whereas the total exposure to AWD21-360 is significantly related to the RA or SA status of subjects. Results further suggest that metabolic switching to the mono-acetylated metabolite AWD21-360 may partially compensate for the impaired glucuronidation capacity in GS subjects. RGB treatment showed no significant differences in tolerability and safety between groups.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

Hepatology. 2006 Apr;43(4):738-41. The prevalence of \"black\" pigment gallstones is increased in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Bile acid malabsorption with augmented bilirubin uptake from the intestine and the development of \"hyperbilirubinbilia\" have been proposed as key factors in gallstone formation in CF patients. We have now tested the hypothesis that the coinheritance of the common UGT1A1 promoter mutation associated with Gilbert syndrome is an additional lithogenic risk factor for gallstone formation in CF. Our results show that patients with CF and gallstones are significantly more likely to carry at least one Gilbert UGT1A1 allele compared with stone-free patients (OR 7.3; P = .042) and that these carriers display significantly higher serum levels of unconjugated bilirubin (P = .002). In conclusion, the Gilbert UGT1A1 allele increases the risk of gallstone formation in CF. This genetic association supports the current concept for gallstone formation in CF and suggests that genetic and exogenous sources contributing to hyperbilirubinbilia might be lithogenic in CF patients.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

Glucuronidation of drugs by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) is a major phase II conjugation reaction. Defects in UGT are associated with Crigler-Najjar syndrome and Gilbert's syndrome with severe hyperbilirubinaemias and jaundice. We analysed the reactivities of some hydroxyquinoline derivatives, which are naturally produced from quinoline by cytochrome P450. The analyses were carried out using a microassay system for UGT activity in bovine liver microsomes in the range 0.5-100 pmol/assay with the highly sensitive radio-image analyser Fuji BAS2500 (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan). 3-Hydroxylquinoline is a good substrate for glucuronidation, and the relative Kcat values were 3.1-fold higher than the values for p-nitrophenol. 5,6-Dihydroquinoline-5,6-trans-diol gave a similar Km value to that of 3-hydroxyquinoline, but the Vmax value was approximately 1/15 of that of p-nitrophenol and showed weak reactivity. Quinoline N-oxide gave a low Vmax value and showed marginal activity. The Kcat values of 6-hydroxyquinoline and 5-hydroxyquinoline were 2.1- and 1.2-fold higher than that of p-nitrophenol, respectively. Fluoroquinoline (FQ) derivatives, such as 3FQ, 7.8diFQ and 6,7,8triFQ, did not show any substrate activities. These results suggest that there are therapeutic problems in administration of some quinoline drugs to patients with jaundice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

       "447  Mai CS, Hamm DM, Banla M, Agossou A, Schulz-Key H, Heuschkel C, Soboslay PT: Onchocerca volvulus-specific antibody and cytokine responses in onchocerciasis patients after 16 years of repeated ivermectin therapy. Clin Exp Immunol. 2007 Mar;147(3):504-12. The recommended control option against onchocerciasis is repeated ivermectin treatment, which will need to be implemented for decades, and it remains unknown how repeated ivermectin therapy might affect immunity against Onchocerca volvulus in the long term. O. volvulus-specific antibody reactivity and cellular cytokine production were investigated in onchocerciasis patients receiving ivermectin (150 microg/kg) annually for 16 years. In treated patients, the T helper type 2 (Th2) cytokine interleukin (IL)-5 and T regulatory IL-10 in response to O. volvulus antigen (OvAg) and bacteria-derived Streptolysin O (SL-O) diminished to levels found in infection-free endemic controls; also, cellular release of Th1-type interferon (IFN)-gamma at 16 years post initial ivermectin treatment (p.i.t.) approached control levels. In ivermectin-treated onchocerciasis patients, IL-5 production in responses to the mitogen phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) decreased, but IL-10 in response PHA increased, and neither attained the cytokine production levels of endemic controls. At 16 years p.i.t., O. volvulus-specific IgG1 and IgG4 subclass reactivity still persisted at higher levels in onchocerciasis patients than in O. volvulus exposed but microfilariae-free endemic controls. In addition, cytokine responses remained depressed in onchocerciasis patients infected concurrently with Mansonella perstans and Necator americanus or Entamoeba histolytica/dispar. Thus, long-term ivermectin therapy of onchocerciasis may not suffice to re-establish fully a balanced Th1 and Th2 immune responsiveness in O. volvulus microfilariae-negative individuals. Such deficient reconstitution of immune competence may be due to an as yet continuing and uncontrolled reinfection with O. volvulus, but parasite co-infections can also bias and may prevent the development of such immunity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "452  Limaye AP, Abrams JS, Silver JE, Awadzi K, Francis HF, Ottesen EA, Nutman TB: Interleukin-5 and the posttreatment eosinophilia in patients with onchocerciasis. J Clin Invest. 1991 Oct;88(4):1418-21. To understand the role of the eosinophilopoietic cytokine IL-5 in humans, the posttreatment eosinophilic response in a group of microfilaria (mf)-positive patients with onchocerciasis (n = 10) was examined before and after treatment with diethylcarbamazine (6 mg/kg for 7 d). Sequential blood samples were assessed at 24 and 1 h before treatment (baseline values), then at frequent intervals over the next 14 d. Symptom scores, skin microfilariae (mf), and peripheral blood eosinophil counts were recorded as a function of time after treatment, and serum levels of IL-5 were quantitated by a highly sensitive (sensitivity greater than or equal to 20 pg/ml) monoclonal-based ELISA. Pretreatment eosinophil counts ranged from 240 to 1,186 eosinophils/microliter (geometric mean, 675), and the mf counts from 10 to 218 per mg skin (geometric mean, 79). After an initial decline in the peripheral eosinophil count to 28 +/- 8% of pretreatment levels at 8 h after beginning treatment, the eosinophil counts steadily increased over the next 2 wk, reaching a maximum at 14 d (257 +/- 38% of pretreatment levels). Serum levels of IL-5 rose sharply from pretreatment levels to a peak of 70.5 +/- 11 pg/ml by 24 h after treatment. Serum IL-5 remained elevated over the next 2-3 d and declined toward baseline by approximately 6 d after treatment, at which time the eosinophil levels were steadily increasing. IL-3 and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor, two other cytokines implicated in eosinophilopoeisis, were not detectable in the serum at any time before or after treatment. The rise in serum IL-5 before the posttreatment eosinophilia seen in this group of patients with onchocerciasis demonstrates a temporal relationship between IL-5 and the subsequent development of eosinophilia and implicates IL-5 as an important mediator of eosinophilia in humans.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "455  Gomez-Priego A, Mendoza R, de-la-Rosa JL: Prevalence of antibodies to onchocerca volvulus in residents of Oaxaca, Mexico, treated for 10 years with ivermectin. Clin Diagn Lab Immunol. 2005 Jan;12(1):40-3. Studies to determine the prevalence of antibodies to Onchocerca volvulus, prior to and after actions carried out to interrupt transmission, are scarce in Mexico. Here we report the prevalence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgG4 antibodies in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) against a crude extract of O. volvulus adult worm in serum samples from persons under noninterrupted biannual treatment with ivermectin in areas of onchocercosis endemicity in Mexico. To perform the prevalence studies, the ELISA procedures were first evaluated. Serological studies were performed with serum samples from skin microfilaria carriers from Guatemala and from people microfilariodermic negative living in the same area as the Guatemalan patients. Sensitivity values for IgG or IgG4 detection were 71 and 86%, while specificities were 92 and 100%, respectively. No anti-O. volvulus antibodies were found in samples from nonendemic controls from Mexico, but 3 of 71 samples from residents in the onchocercosis area of Oaxaca, Mexico, and who have been under ivermectin treatment during the last 10 years were only positive to IgG. Notwithstanding that the IgG4 isotype was not detected and a low (4.2%) anti-O. volvulus IgG antibody prevalence was found, a seroepidemiological follow-up must be performed in order to confirm interruption of onchocercosis transmission in the area of Oaxaca, Mexico, in which onchocercosis is endemic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

Clin Exp Immunol. 1988 Nov;74(2):223-9. Individual human Ig class responses to Onchocerca volvulus antigens have been evaluated by Western blotting using sera from cases of generalized onchocerciasis and chronic hyper-reactive onchocerciasis (Sowda). in all cases except IgG3 the patterns of recognition by human antibody classes were similar in Sowda and generalized onchocerciasis. Weak or undetectable responses were seen with IgG1, IgG2 and IgM. The total profiles of antigens recognized by the other Ig classes were different, although in some cases certain bands were commonly identified. The result with IgG3, however, was striking. Here, two major antigens (9 kD and 72kD) were recognized by IgG3 antibodies in Sowda sera but not generalized onchocerciasis sera. Furthermore, these two antigens were not recognised by any other Ig class, either in generalized or Sowda onchocerciasis, nor were they detected by antibodies of any class present in a collection of sera representative of other nematode infections. This difference in the IgG3 response was so pronounced that Sowda sera could be distinguished from generalized onchocerciasis sera by an IgG3-specific ELISA assay with a PBS parasite extract as the antigen. Thus, a correlation has been established between one particular clinical condition of onchocerciasis (Sowda) and a serological response, defined in terms of both the parasite antigens and an immunoglobulin class restricted antibody response.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

Clin Immunol. 2000 Apr;95(1 Pt 1):51-61. The roles of eotaxin, RANTES, and MCP-3 expression in eosinophil recruitment to the site of parasite killing that occurs following ivermectin treatment of onchocerciasis were assessed in the skin of 13 Onchocerca volvulus-infected subjects and two noninfected controls before and after ivermectin treatment. Adverse reactions in infected subjects were associated with the appearance of eosinophils in the dermis as part of a perivascular inflammatory infiltrate. Although no expression of RANTES and eotaxin was seen in dermal vascular endothelial cells in biopsies taken before treatment (nor at any time in the skin of uninfected controls), endothelial expression of both eotaxin and RANTES was noted by 24 h following treatment. While RANTES expression was transient, eotaxin expression increased in parallel with increasing eosinophil recruitment up to 60 h posttreatment. These observations indicate that endothelial expression of eotaxin and RANTES may have an important role in eosinophil recruitment into the skin during helminth-killing reactions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

Parasite Immunol. 1996 Sep;18(9):479-82. Diethylcarbamazine (DEC) induced clearance of microfilaraemia in loiasis is associated with severe posttreatment reactions. To define the switch from hypo- to hyper-responsiveness associated with DEC treatment, phenotypic alterations of T-lymphocytes, characterized by flow cytometry, and cytokines, determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, were monitored in a microfilaraemic patient. In contrast to reports on onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariases, no elevation of interleukin (IL)-6 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha was observed. The most severe side effects coincided with an elevation of interferon (IFN)-gamma on day 3, followed by IL-10, transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta 2 and macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha (MIP-1 alpha) peaking on day 5. Phenotypically, T-cell activation markers CD38, CD54 and CD25 were significantly expressed before treatment, with high CD38 expression still existing one year after clearance of microfilaraemia. Treatment-related increases were observed with anti-CD122, anti-HLA-DR and anti-CD69. CD28 was expressed before treatment on almost 100% of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and dropped to 20% by day 5, reaching again baseline levels on day 21. Furthermore, there emerged 20% TCR alpha beta+/CD3+ T cells and 10% anti-beta V5 (c)+ T cells, altogether indicating a specific pattern of T-helper (Th) 1 and Th2 cytokines as well as expansion of certain pauciclonal T-cell populations in response to microfilarial clearance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "466  Njoo FL, Hack CE, Oosting J, Luyendijk L, Stilma JS, Kijlstra A: C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 are elevated in onchocerciasis patients after ivermectin treatment. J Infect Dis. 1994 Sep;170(3):663-8. Ivermectin treatment of onchocerciasis can induce adverse reactions. Mechanisms underlying these reactions are poorly understood but may include activation of neutrophils. This study investigated the acute-phase response in onchocerciasis patients during 2 days after ivermectin treatment. The acute-phase protein C-reactive protein (CRP) and cytokines that mediate the acute-phase response (tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF alpha] and interleukin-6 [IL-6]) were measured in 144 skin snip-positive onchocerciasis patients and 12 skin snip-negative controls who received one dose of ivermectin (150 micrograms/kg). No elevated TNF alpha levels were found, but IL-6 and CRP were elevated in 25.7% and 50.7% of the patients, respectively, after ivermectin treatment. Most patients (89.2%) with raised IL-6 also had raised CRP. Such increases were not observed in controls and in patients were correlated with adverse reactions and microfilarial densities. These findings suggest a possible role of the acute-phase response in microfilarial destruction following ivermectin treatment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

Clin Exp Immunol. 2005 Nov;142(2):318-26. Ivermectin treatment will effectively diminish microfilariae (Mf) of Onchocerca volvulus in the skin of patients, but therapy is associated with adverse host inflammatory responses. To investigate the association of proinflammatory chemokines with the intensity of infection and clinical adverse reactions, chemokine serum levels were measured in patients following ivermectin treatment (100 microg/kg, 150 microg/kg or 200 microg/kg) or placebo. The density of O. volvulus Mf per mg skin decreased by 85%, 97%, 97% and 90% at day 3, at month 3, month 6 and at 1 year post-ivermectin. The cutaneous T cell-attracting chemokine (CTACK/CCL27) was found highly elevated in onchocerciasis patients compared to infection-free European controls (P = 0.0004) and it did not change following ivermectin or placebo to 1 year post-therapy. The chemokine RANTES/CCL5 (regulated on activated and normally T cell-expressed) was similarly high in onchocerciasis patients and infection-free European controls; the RANTES/CCL5 levels did not change following treatment until 6 months post-therapy but were slightly elevated at 1 year post-therapy (P thymus and activation regulated chemokine (TARC/CCL17) and macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC/CCL22), were activated at 3 days post-ivermectin (P protein (MIP)-1alpha/CCL3 and MIP-1beta/CCL4 were low before ivermectin treatment, but following clearance of microfilariae of O. volvulus their levels increased from 6 months post-therapy onwards (for both at 12 months post-therapy, P ivermectin or with the serum levels of MIP-1alpha/CCL3, MIP-1beta/CCL4, TARC/CCL17, MDC/CCL22 and CTACK/CCL27. Our observations suggest that following ivermectin, macrophages as well as memory Th2-type lymphocytes and B cells, attracted and activated by MDC/CCL22, TARC/CCL17 and CTACK/CCL27, may contribute to dermal immune responses and O. volvulus Mf killing and clearance. The transient changes of TARC/CCL17 and MDC/CCL22 were not associated with clinical adverse responses, and the later rise of MIP-1alpha/CCL3 and MIP-1beta/CCL4 showed a reactivation of Type 1 immune responses associated with persistent low levels of O. volvulus microfilariae and an expiring O. volvulus infection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

Clin Immunol. 2000 Apr;95(1 Pt 1):51-61. The roles of eotaxin, RANTES, and MCP-3 expression in eosinophil recruitment to the site of parasite killing that occurs following ivermectin treatment of onchocerciasis were assessed in the skin of 13 Onchocerca volvulus-infected subjects and two noninfected controls before and after ivermectin treatment. Adverse reactions in infected subjects were associated with the appearance of eosinophils in the dermis as part of a perivascular inflammatory infiltrate. Although no expression of RANTES and eotaxin was seen in dermal vascular endothelial cells in biopsies taken before treatment (nor at any time in the skin of uninfected controls), endothelial expression of both eotaxin and RANTES was noted by 24 h following treatment. While RANTES expression was transient, eotaxin expression increased in parallel with increasing eosinophil recruitment up to 60 h posttreatment. These observations indicate that endothelial expression of eotaxin and RANTES may have an important role in eosinophil recruitment into the skin during helminth-killing reactions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

Serum (or plasma) levels of total and mature tryptase measurements are recommended in the diagnostic evaluation of systemic anaphylaxis and systemic mastocytosis, but their interpretation must be considered in the context of a complete workup of each patient. Total tryptase levels generally reflect the increased burden of mast cells in patients with all forms of systemic mastocytosis (indolent systemic mastocytosis, smoldering systemic mastocytosis, systemic mastocytosis associated with a hematologic clonal non-mast cell disorder, aggressive systemic mastocytosis, and mast cell leukemia) and the decreased burden of mast cells associated with cytoreductive therapies in these disorders. Causes of an elevated total tryptase level other than systemic mastocytosis must be considered, however, and include systemic anaphylaxis, acute myelocytic leukemia, various myelodysplastic syndromes, hypereosinophilic syndrome associated with the FLP1L1-PDGFRA mutation, end-stage renal failure, and treatment of onchocerciasis. Mature (beta) tryptase levels generally reflect the magnitude of mast cell activation and are elevated during most cases of systemic anaphylaxis, particularly with parenteral exposure to the inciting agent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

Ivermectin is a safe and effective drug for onchocerciasis treatment. In certain individuals, however, therapy is accompanied by adverse reactions. The mechanisms underlying these reactions are not yet known. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether neutrophils are involved in the development of these adverse reactions. Elastase and lactoferrin, two markers for the release of neutrophil azurophilic and specific granule contents respectively, were measured by radioimmunoassays in plasma of onchocerciasis patients with varying degrees of side effects, as well as in control subjects before and 1 and 2 days after ivermectin treatment. A considerable increase of elastase levels after treatment was observed, whereas lactoferrin levels did not change. The percentage of patients with elevated elastase levels was significantly correlated with the degree of side effects. These findings suggest that neutrophil activation may be involved in the development of adverse reactions in these patients.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

Clin Exp Immunol. 1993 Mar;91(3):437-41. Autoantibodies in sera from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and onchocerciasis recognize calreticulin (CaR), a calcium-binding protein, as antigen. In this study we present the immunological properties of two synthetic peptides prepared to correspond to the 1-24 and 7-24 amino acid sequence of CaR. In contrast to information previously reported for the recombinant protein, the CaR-peptide analogues appeared immunoreactive to anti-Ro/SSA autoimmune sera. Human sera from patients with SLE, Sjogren's syndrome (SS), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), as well as mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD), demonstrated a positive autoimmune response (binding of antibodies), to the CaR-peptide analogues. These findings suggest that anti-calreticulin autoantibodies are not restricted to any disease specificity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "478  Rokeach LA, Zimmerman PA, Unnasch TR: Epitopes of the Onchocerca volvulus RAL1 antigen, a member of the calreticulin family of proteins, recognized by sera from patients with onchocerciasis. Infect Immun. 1994 Sep;62(9):3696-704. RAL1 is an antigen (Ag) encoded by the filarial nematode Onchocerca volvulus, the parasite causing onchocerciasis (river blindness). RAL1 shares 64.4% identity with the autoantigen calreticulin. The striking similarity of the parasite Ag and the human autoantigen has led to the hypothesis that RAL1 may induce a cross-reactive immune response to calreticulin, which in turn may be involved in the pathogenesis of onchocerciasis. To test this hypothesis, we explored the immune response to RAL1 recombinant Ag (RAL1 rAg) and human calreticulin in patients with O. volvulus infection. A total of 86% of the O. volvulus-infected individuals produced antibodies recognizing RAL1 rAg. Antibody reactivity to RAL1 rAg in patient sera was confined primarily to the central and carboxyl-terminal parts of the molecule. No significant correlations were found to associate recognition of RAL1 rAg, or any particular portion thereof, with a particular disease state. Antibodies against RAL1 thus appear to be produced as a general immune reaction to O. volvulus infection and do not necessarily lead to a cross-reacting response with the host protein. In contrast, 33% of the patient sera tested bound recombinant human calreticulin. All of these sera also recognized a polypeptide encompassing the carboxyl-terminal portion of the RAL1 rAg. These results suggest that recognition of an epitope encoded in the carboxyl-terminal portion of RAL1 is at least in part responsible for inducing a cross-reacting immune response to the host protein.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

Clin Exp Immunol. 1996 Aug;105(2):245-53. Chronic and generalized onchocerciasis is associated with suppression of the parasite-specific cellular responsiveness, while exposed individuals without parasitological and clinical evidence of infection (endemic normals) display prominent cellular reactivity to Onchocerca volvulus antigens (OvAg). In order to identify those parasite antigens which may account for this differential cellular responsiveness, total adult worm-derived OvAg were fractionated by means of preparative SDS-PAGE and blot-elution into 22 antigen fractions of continuously decreasing molecular weight. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from microfilariae (mf)-positive onchocerciasis patients (n = 18) proliferated weakly in response to all OvAg fractions. In contrast, in vitro reactivity of PBMC from endemic normals (n = 9) was depressed in response to OvAg of mol. wt 200-30 kD only, while antigens of mol. wt observed in response to OvAg of mol. wt 15-11 kD. Furthermore, these low mol. wt antigen fractions induced substantial production of IL-2 and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in PBMC from endemic normals, but not in those from onchocerciasis patients. Cells from individuals of both groups secreted similar amounts of IL-5 in response to all OvAg fractions, with highest production again being induced by low mol. wt OvAg. In contrast, PBMC from onchocerciasis patients clearly produced more IL-10 than did cells from endemic normals. This augmented IL-10 production by PBMC from mf-positive individuals was not only observed after stimulation with OvAg fractions, but was measured in unstimulated control cultures as well. IFN-gamma-specific mRNA in antigen-stimulated PBMC from endemic normals appeared to be more prominent than in cells from onchocerciasis patients. However, mRNA transcripts of IL-10 and IL-13 were clearly present in patients, but were absent or inconsistently observed in endemic normals. Our results suggest that vigorous Th1-type cellular responsiveness encountered in endemic normals is restricted to low mol. wt antigens of O. volvulus, while such reactivity will not be present in mf-positive individuals. Furthermore, spontaneous production of high levels of IL-10 in onchocerciasis patients is likely to suppress Th1-type immunity, and thus may favour manifestation of chronic onchocerciasis. These traits of cellular immunity may contribute to the differential outcome of O. volvulus infection, the manifestation of clinical disease, and may also regulate the build up of acquired immunity in humans.   \n",

Clin Exp Immunol. 1994 May;96(2):238-44. The present study examined the quantitative and qualitative changes registered in the parasite-specific antibody response, cellular reactivity and cytokine production profile in onchocerciasis patients repeatedly treated with ivermectin over a period of 8 years. The densities of Onchocerca volvulus microfilariae (mf) in treated patients remained significantly reduced, whereas the number of permanently amicrofilaridermic patients (subclinical infection) increased with repeated treatments. In vitro cellular responses to O. volvulus antigen (OvAg) were highest (P volvulus (endemic normals). Cellular reactivity in repeatedly treated patients was higher at 84 than at 36 months post initial treatment (p.i.t); furthermore, the proliferative responses to OvAg, mycobacterial purified protein derivative (PPD) and streptococcal SL-O were greater (P onchocerciasis patients. In amicrofilaridermic patients such reactivity approached the magnitude observed in endemic normals. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from patients and endemic normals produced equivalent amounts of IL-2, IL-4 and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in response to mitogenic stimulation with phytohaemagglutinin (PHA); in response to OvAg, however, significantly more IL-2 and IFN-gamma were produced by PBMC from subclinical amicrofilaridermic patients or endemic normals than by mf-positive patients. OvAg-specific production of IL-4 by PBMC from treated patients was lower at 84 than at 36 months p.i.t. At three months p.i.t. the titres of circulating OvAg-specific IgG1-3 had increased (P declined with repeated treatments. Only IgG1 and IgG4 bound to OvAg of mol. wt 2-12 kD at 1 month p.i.t., while recognition of OvAg of mol. wt 10-200 kD by IgG1, IgG2 and IgG4 reached a maximum intensity at 3-6 months p.i.t., with the overall intensity of binding to OvAg gradually weakening thereafter. These results suggest that onchocerciasis-associated immunosuppression is reversible following ivermectin-induced permanent clearance of microfilariae from the skin; and that a vigorous parasite-specific cellular reactivity and a sustained production of IL-2 and IFN-gamma in amicrofilaridermic individuals may contribute to controlling O. volvulus infection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

We conclude that the augmentation of baseline NK cell activity, as well as interferon- and interleukin-2-enhanced NK cell activity seen in the patients, is not a direct effect of DEC, but is related to the reaction to DEC in lymphatic filariasis and onchocerciasis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

Trop Med Int Health. 1997 Jul;2(7):691-4. An expression vector, pOVEX, has been designed and constructed, combining the advantages of the expression vectors pGEX-3X and pJC2o. The pOVEX vector produces a fusion protein with the 24 kD Onchocerca volvulus glutathione S-transferase (OvGST2) which is easy to purify in one step from bacterial extracts under non-denaturing conditions using glutathione-sepharose chromatography. High yields of fusion protein were produced from this T7 RNA polymerase-dependent expression vector, which were then cleaved by digestion with the factor Xa protease to separate the OVGST2 polypeptide from the expressed protein of interest. This vector will be particularly useful to O. volvulus investigators for the production of O. volvulus antigens for the analyses of host humoral and cellular responses to these proteins and for immunization studies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

Clin Exp Immunol. 2005 Nov;142(2):318-26. Ivermectin treatment will effectively diminish microfilariae (Mf) of Onchocerca volvulus in the skin of patients, but therapy is associated with adverse host inflammatory responses. To investigate the association of proinflammatory chemokines with the intensity of infection and clinical adverse reactions, chemokine serum levels were measured in patients following ivermectin treatment (100 microg/kg, 150 microg/kg or 200 microg/kg) or placebo. The density of O. volvulus Mf per mg skin decreased by 85%, 97%, 97% and 90% at day 3, at month 3, month 6 and at 1 year post-ivermectin. The cutaneous T cell-attracting chemokine (CTACK/CCL27) was found highly elevated in onchocerciasis patients compared to infection-free European controls (P = 0.0004) and it did not change following ivermectin or placebo to 1 year post-therapy. The chemokine RANTES/CCL5 (regulated on activated and normally T cell-expressed) was similarly high in onchocerciasis patients and infection-free European controls; the RANTES/CCL5 levels did not change following treatment until 6 months post-therapy but were slightly elevated at 1 year post-therapy (P thymus and activation regulated chemokine (TARC/CCL17) and macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC/CCL22), were activated at 3 days post-ivermectin (P protein (MIP)-1alpha/CCL3 and MIP-1beta/CCL4 were low before ivermectin treatment, but following clearance of microfilariae of O. volvulus their levels increased from 6 months post-therapy onwards (for both at 12 months post-therapy, P ivermectin or with the serum levels of MIP-1alpha/CCL3, MIP-1beta/CCL4, TARC/CCL17, MDC/CCL22 and CTACK/CCL27. Our observations suggest that following ivermectin, macrophages as well as memory Th2-type lymphocytes and B cells, attracted and activated by MDC/CCL22, TARC/CCL17 and CTACK/CCL27, may contribute to dermal immune responses and O. volvulus Mf killing and clearance. The transient changes of TARC/CCL17 and MDC/CCL22 were not associated with clinical adverse responses, and the later rise of MIP-1alpha/CCL3 and MIP-1beta/CCL4 showed a reactivation of Type 1 immune responses associated with persistent low levels of O. volvulus microfilariae and an expiring O. volvulus infection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

Clin Exp Immunol. 2007 Mar;147(3):504-12. The recommended control option against onchocerciasis is repeated ivermectin treatment, which will need to be implemented for decades, and it remains unknown how repeated ivermectin therapy might affect immunity against Onchocerca volvulus in the long term. O. volvulus-specific antibody reactivity and cellular cytokine production were investigated in onchocerciasis patients receiving ivermectin (150 microg/kg) annually for 16 years. In treated patients, the T helper type 2 (Th2) cytokine interleukin (IL)-5 and T regulatory IL-10 in response to O. volvulus antigen (OvAg) and bacteria-derived Streptolysin O (SL-O) diminished to levels found in infection-free endemic controls; also, cellular release of Th1-type interferon (IFN)-gamma at 16 years post initial ivermectin treatment (p.i.t.) approached control levels. In ivermectin-treated onchocerciasis patients, IL-5 production in responses to the mitogen phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) decreased, but IL-10 in response PHA increased, and neither attained the cytokine production levels of endemic controls. At 16 years p.i.t., O. volvulus-specific IgG1 and IgG4 subclass reactivity still persisted at higher levels in onchocerciasis patients than in O. volvulus exposed but microfilariae-free endemic controls. In addition, cytokine responses remained depressed in onchocerciasis patients infected concurrently with Mansonella perstans and Necator americanus or Entamoeba histolytica/dispar. Thus, long-term ivermectin therapy of onchocerciasis may not suffice to re-establish fully a balanced Th1 and Th2 immune responsiveness in O. volvulus microfilariae-negative individuals. Such deficient reconstitution of immune competence may be due to an as yet continuing and uncontrolled reinfection with O. volvulus, but parasite co-infections can also bias and may prevent the development of such immunity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

J Infect Dis. 1998 Oct;178(4):1133-8. Onchocerca volvulus infection has been associated with impaired cellular responses to parasite antigens, an impairment that may also extend to nonparasite antigens. To investigate the mechanism of this impaired immune response, the effect of concurrent O. volvulus infection on the immune response to tetanus toxoid (TT) following tetanus vaccination was studied. The proliferative, cytokine, and antibody response to TT of O. volvulus-infected subjects (n = 19) and comparable noninfected controls (n = 20) were studied before and 6 months after vaccination with TT. Following vaccination, antibody levels, proliferative responses, and levels of interferon-gamma were significantly greater in noninfected subjects (P produced interleukin-10, but noninfected controls did not (P volvulus can diminish the immune response to an unrelated antigen (TT) by a mechanism that is likely to involve interleukin-10.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

Clin Exp Immunol. 1996 Aug;105(2):245-53. Chronic and generalized onchocerciasis is associated with suppression of the parasite-specific cellular responsiveness, while exposed individuals without parasitological and clinical evidence of infection (endemic normals) display prominent cellular reactivity to Onchocerca volvulus antigens (OvAg). In order to identify those parasite antigens which may account for this differential cellular responsiveness, total adult worm-derived OvAg were fractionated by means of preparative SDS-PAGE and blot-elution into 22 antigen fractions of continuously decreasing molecular weight. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from microfilariae (mf)-positive onchocerciasis patients (n = 18) proliferated weakly in response to all OvAg fractions. In contrast, in vitro reactivity of PBMC from endemic normals (n = 9) was depressed in response to OvAg of mol. wt 200-30 kD only, while antigens of mol. wt observed in response to OvAg of mol. wt 15-11 kD. Furthermore, these low mol. wt antigen fractions induced substantial production of IL-2 and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in PBMC from endemic normals, but not in those from onchocerciasis patients. Cells from individuals of both groups secreted similar amounts of IL-5 in response to all OvAg fractions, with highest production again being induced by low mol. wt OvAg. In contrast, PBMC from onchocerciasis patients clearly produced more IL-10 than did cells from endemic normals. This augmented IL-10 production by PBMC from mf-positive individuals was not only observed after stimulation with OvAg fractions, but was measured in unstimulated control cultures as well. IFN-gamma-specific mRNA in antigen-stimulated PBMC from endemic normals appeared to be more prominent than in cells from onchocerciasis patients. However, mRNA transcripts of IL-10 and IL-13 were clearly present in patients, but were absent or inconsistently observed in endemic normals. Our results suggest that vigorous Th1-type cellular responsiveness encountered in endemic normals is restricted to low mol. wt antigens of O. volvulus, while such reactivity will not be present in mf-positive individuals. Furthermore, spontaneous production of high levels of IL-10 in onchocerciasis patients is likely to suppress Th1-type immunity, and thus may favour manifestation of chronic onchocerciasis. These traits of cellular immunity may contribute to the differential outcome of O. volvulus infection, the manifestation of clinical disease, and may also regulate the build up of acquired immunity in humans.   \n",

Parasite Immunol. 1996 Sep;18(9):479-82. Diethylcarbamazine (DEC) induced clearance of microfilaraemia in loiasis is associated with severe posttreatment reactions. To define the switch from hypo- to hyper-responsiveness associated with DEC treatment, phenotypic alterations of T-lymphocytes, characterized by flow cytometry, and cytokines, determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, were monitored in a microfilaraemic patient. In contrast to reports on onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariases, no elevation of interleukin (IL)-6 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha was observed. The most severe side effects coincided with an elevation of interferon (IFN)-gamma on day 3, followed by IL-10, transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta 2 and macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha (MIP-1 alpha) peaking on day 5. Phenotypically, T-cell activation markers CD38, CD54 and CD25 were significantly expressed before treatment, with high CD38 expression still existing one year after clearance of microfilaraemia. Treatment-related increases were observed with anti-CD122, anti-HLA-DR and anti-CD69. CD28 was expressed before treatment on almost 100% of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and dropped to 20% by day 5, reaching again baseline levels on day 21. Furthermore, there emerged 20% TCR alpha beta+/CD3+ T cells and 10% anti-beta V5 (c)+ T cells, altogether indicating a specific pattern of T-helper (Th) 1 and Th2 cytokines as well as expansion of certain pauciclonal T-cell populations in response to microfilarial clearance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "502  Hogarth PJ, Bianco AE: Interleukin-12 modulates T-cell responses to microfilariae but fails to abrogate interleukin-5-dependent immunity in a mouse model of onchocerciasis. Immunology. 1999 Nov;98(3):406-12. Infection of mice with microfilariae of Onchocerca lienalis induces high levels of protective immunity to reinfection, which is dependent on interleukin (IL)-5 but not IL-4. Here, we have investigated the effect of exogenous IL-12 administration during either the priming or effector phases of the immune response. When administered during priming, IL-12 induced down-regulation of parasite-specific serum immunoglobulin (Ig) E and up-regulation of IgG2a. Antigen-specific IL-4 responses were strongly suppressed, whilst blood eosinophil levels were partially reduced. When administered during a challenge infection, IL-12 did not significantly influence the balance of antibody isotypes, but partially reduced eosinophil production. Antigen-specific IL-4 responses were again completely ablated. Unusually, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) responses were not significantly affected following IL-12 administration, either during priming or after challenge infections. Moreover, despite a fall in antigen-specific IL-5 production, the expression of IL-5-dependent immunity, as determined by reduction in worm recoveries, was fully maintained. These data demonstrate that parasite-induced IL-4 can be abrogated without affecting protective immunity to Onchocerca microfilariae in mice. In view of the established role of IL-4 in pathogenesis, this may have important implications for the development of immunoprophylaxis aimed at microfilariae and the alleviation of pathology in onchocerciasis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

Am J Trop Med Hyg. 1996 May;54(5):490-7. An Onchocerca volvulus expression library was differentially screened to identify a molecular marker distinguishing sowda (lichenified onchodermatitis) from other onchocerciasis forms. One clone, PG3, was recognized by pooled sera from patients with sowda, but not by pooled sera from patients with generalized onchocerciasis; it was not recognized by sera from patients with lymphatic filariasis or other helminth infections. The DNA of PG3 hybridized strongly with O. volvulus Eco RI-digested DNA, but not with DNA from Brugia spp., Trichinella spp., and humans. A weak reaction was observed with DNA from O. gibsoni and Acanthocheilonema viteae. The PG3 DNA sequence showed a high homology with both human and nematode collagens. Confirmation of the collagen-like nature of the sowda-specific PG3 product was obtained by amino terminal sequencing of the PG3 expression product, as well as by demonstrating its susceptibility to collagenase digestion. The characteristic recognition of the O. volvulus collagen specified by clone PG3 was confirmed by measuring antibody levels to the expressed product in individual sowda and generalized onchocerciasis sera, respectively. Identification of a nematode collagen antigen mainly recognized in sowda patients raises the possibility that this extreme form of dermatitis might arise through cross-reactivity between anti-O. volvulus collagen antibodies and human collagen. However, a relationship between the PG3 recognition by antibodies and the sowda pathogenesis could not be demonstrated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

Furthermore, there emerged 20% TCR alpha beta+/CD3+ T cells and 10% anti-beta V5 (c)+ T cells, altogether indicating a specific pattern of T-helper (Th) 1 and Th2 cytokines as well as expansion of certain pauciclonal T-cell populations in response to microfilarial clearance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

J Infect Dis. 1994 Sep;170(3):663-8. Ivermectin treatment of onchocerciasis can induce adverse reactions. Mechanisms underlying these reactions are poorly understood but may include activation of neutrophils. This study investigated the acute-phase response in onchocerciasis patients during 2 days after ivermectin treatment. The acute-phase protein C-reactive protein (CRP) and cytokines that mediate the acute-phase response (tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF alpha] and interleukin-6 [IL-6]) were measured in 144 skin snip-positive onchocerciasis patients and 12 skin snip-negative controls who received one dose of ivermectin (150 micrograms/kg). No elevated TNF alpha levels were found, but IL-6 and CRP were elevated in 25.7% and 50.7% of the patients, respectively, after ivermectin treatment. Most patients (89.2%) with raised IL-6 also had raised CRP. Such increases were not observed in controls and in patients were correlated with adverse reactions and microfilarial densities. These findings suggest a possible role of the acute-phase response in microfilarial destruction following ivermectin treatment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "513  Cooper PJ, Beck LA, Espinel I, Deyampert NM, Hartnell A, Jose PJ, Paredes W, Guderian RH, Nutman TB: Eotaxin and RANTES expression by the dermal endothelium is associated with eosinophil infiltration after ivermectin treatment of onchocerciasis. Clin Immunol. 2000 Apr;95(1 Pt 1):51-61. The roles of eotaxin, RANTES, and MCP-3 expression in eosinophil recruitment to the site of parasite killing that occurs following ivermectin treatment of onchocerciasis were assessed in the skin of 13 Onchocerca volvulus-infected subjects and two noninfected controls before and after ivermectin treatment. Adverse reactions in infected subjects were associated with the appearance of eosinophils in the dermis as part of a perivascular inflammatory infiltrate. Although no expression of RANTES and eotaxin was seen in dermal vascular endothelial cells in biopsies taken before treatment (nor at any time in the skin of uninfected controls), endothelial expression of both eotaxin and RANTES was noted by 24 h following treatment. While RANTES expression was transient, eotaxin expression increased in parallel with increasing eosinophil recruitment up to 60 h posttreatment. These observations indicate that endothelial expression of eotaxin and RANTES may have an important role in eosinophil recruitment into the skin during helminth-killing reactions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

Trop Med Parasitol. 1992 Mar;43(1):47-53. Monoclonal antibodies, reactive with antigens solubilised from the body wall of intact female Onchocerca volvulus using 2% 2-beta-mercaptoethanol, have been characterised. Two IgG1 antibodies, Cam1 and Cam28, recognised antigens of apparent molecular weights of 18,000 and 28,000; and 120,000, respectively. The target antigens of Cam1 and Cam28 could be localised in the cuticle. Inhibition ELISAs showed that target epitopes of both monoclonal antibodies induce an antibody response in onchocerciasis patients. 153 sera from Sierra Leonean patients were tested for their individual antibody levels against antigen epitopes recognised by Cam1 and Cam28. Patients within the age of 5-8 years had the highest levels of antibodies against the Cam28-epitope, whereas patients above 60 years had almost none. Amicrofilaremic patients had higher anti-Cam28 antibody levels than microfilaremic patients and there was a significant difference between groups with no chronic skin disease and those with mild or severe signs. A high percentage of patients (80.4%) recognised the Cam1-epitope, highest antibody levels being found in patients within the age group of 15 to 45 years and in microfilaremic patients. However, levels of antibodies inhibiting monoclonal antibody Cam1 could not be correlated with presence or absence of skin disease.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

We conclude that the augmentation of baseline NK cell activity, as well as interferon- and interleukin-2-enhanced NK cell activity seen in the patients, is not a direct effect of DEC, but is related to the reaction to DEC in lymphatic filariasis and onchocerciasis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "520  Njoo FL, Hack CE, Oosting J, Luyendijk L, Stilma JS, Kijlstra A: C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 are elevated in onchocerciasis patients after ivermectin treatment. J Infect Dis. 1994 Sep;170(3):663-8. Ivermectin treatment of onchocerciasis can induce adverse reactions. Mechanisms underlying these reactions are poorly understood but may include activation of neutrophils. This study investigated the acute-phase response in onchocerciasis patients during 2 days after ivermectin treatment. The acute-phase protein C-reactive protein (CRP) and cytokines that mediate the acute-phase response (tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF alpha] and interleukin-6 [IL-6]) were measured in 144 skin snip-positive onchocerciasis patients and 12 skin snip-negative controls who received one dose of ivermectin (150 micrograms/kg). No elevated TNF alpha levels were found, but IL-6 and CRP were elevated in 25.7% and 50.7% of the patients, respectively, after ivermectin treatment. Most patients (89.2%) with raised IL-6 also had raised CRP. Such increases were not observed in controls and in patients were correlated with adverse reactions and microfilarial densities. These findings suggest a possible role of the acute-phase response in microfilarial destruction following ivermectin treatment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
