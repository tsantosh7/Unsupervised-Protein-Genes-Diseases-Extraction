Alkaptonuria	fumarylacetoacetate-hydrolase	Negative	PMID:10518553	Manning K, Al-Dhalimy M, Finegold M, Grompe M: In vivo suppressor mutations correct a murine model of hereditary tyrosinemia type I. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1999 Oct 12;96(21):11928-33. Hereditary tyrosinemia type I and alkaptonuria are disorders of tyrosine catabolism caused by deficiency of fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH) and homogentisic acid dioxygenase (HGD), respectively. Tyrosinemia is a severe childhood disease that affects the liver and kidneys, but alkaptonuria is a more benign adult disorder in comparison. Because HGD is upstream of FAH in the tyrosine pathway, mice doubly mutant in both enzymes were found to be protected from the liver and renal damage of tyrosinemia as hypothesized. Mice mutant at the tyrosinemic locus but heterozygous for alkaptonuria spontaneously developed clonal nodules of functionally normal hepatocytes that were able to rescue the livers of some mice with this genotype. This phenotypic rescue was a result of an inactivating mutation of the wild-type homogentisic acid dioxygenase gene, thus presenting an example of an in vivo suppressor mutation in a mammalian model.
Alkaptonuria	4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate-dioxygenase	Negative	PMID:15931605	Suwannarat P, O'Brien K, Perry MB, Sebring N, Bernardini I, Kaiser-Kupfer MI, Rubin BI, Tsilou E, Gerber LH, Gahl WA: Use of nitisinone in patients with alkaptonuria. Metabolism. 2005 Jun;54(6):719-28. Alkaptonuria, a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the HGD gene and deficiency of homogentisate 1,2 dioxygenase, is characterized by ochronosis, arthritis, and daily excretion of gram quantities of homogentisic acid (HGA). Nitisinone, an inhibitor of the enzyme 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase, can drastically reduce urinary excretion of HGA in individuals with alkaptonuria. We investigated the safety and the HGA-depleting efficacy of nitisinone in an open-label, single-center study of 9 alkaptonuria patients (5 women, 4 men; 35-69 years of age) over the course of 3 to 4 months. Each patient received nitisinone in incremental doses, 0.35 mg bid followed by 1.05 mg bid, and remained on this dosage and a regular diet for 3 months. Nitisinone reduced urinary HGA levels from an average of 4.0 +/- 1.8 (SD) g/day to 0.2 +/- 0.2 g/day ( P tyrosine concentration, initially 68 +/- 18 mmicro mol/L, rose to 760 +/- 181 micro mol/L ( P protein-restricted diet (40 g/day), and their mean plasma tyrosine level fell from 755 +/- 167 to 603 +/- 114 mu mol/L. Six of the 7 patients who received nitisinone for more than 1 week reported decreased pain in their affected joints. Weekly ophthalmologic examinations showed no signs of corneal toxicity. Adverse events included the passing of kidney stones, the recognition of symptoms related to aortic stenosis, and elevation of liver transaminase levels. We conclude that low-dose nitisinone effectively reduced urinary HGA levels in patients with alkaptonuria. Future long-term clinical trials are planned to determine the benefits of nitisinone in preventing joint deterioration and providing pain relief, and its long-term side effects.
Alkaptonuria	HLA-complex	Negative	PMID:300896	Gaucher A, Netter P, Fuare G, Raffoux C, Chanson B, Baumgartner J, Psurel J, Streiff F: [HLA-B27 antigen and alkaptonuria] . Rev Rhum Mal Osteoartic. 1977 Apr;44(4):273-7. Study of urinary homogentisic acid and a determinantion of group HLA were carried out for 36 members of a family spread over three generations with three cases of ochronotic rheumatism in the second generation. Alkaptonuria was discovered in seven other subjects, six of them members of the third generation: urinary elimination was poor, less than 0.60 g/24 hours. There is a certain degree of consanguinity in the family studied here and these findings do not therefore rule out a recessive autosomal transmission of the alkaptonuria. They do however lead to the consideration that alkaptonuria may sometimes be found in heterozygotic subjects. A genetic relationship between HLA complex and alkaptonuria can only be claimed with difficulty from this familial study, but the high frequency of B 27 antigen (29 out of 36 members carring it) leaves room for the hypothesis that the B 27 gene, or more precisely a gene associated with the B 27 gene, plays a part in the development of ochronotic rheumatism.
Alkaptonuria	collagen	Negative	PMID:3180550	Forslind K, Wollheim FA, Akesson B, Rydholm U: Alkaptonuria and ochronosis in three siblings. Clin Exp Rheumatol. 1988 Jul-Sep;6(3):289-92. Ascorbic acid treatment monitored by urinary HGA excretion. Patients with alkaptonuria lack homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase leading to retention of homogentistic acid (HGA) in body fluids and eventually to tissue deposition of oxidation products, giving rise to the clinical picture of ochronosis. Ascorbic acid is a known inhibitor of the enzyme which catalyses the oxidation of homogentisic acid (HGA) to the polymer with affinity for collagen and was used in the treatment of three siblings with alkaptonuria. Ascorbic acid 500 mg bid was administered for 12 months. Two of the siblings tolerated the treatment, and in one the symptoms improved, whereas in the other they worsened. Plasma and urinary levels of HGA were monitored with a new HPLC method. Ascorbic acid is not effective in the treatment of symptomatic ochronosis.
Cylindromatosis	APOA4	Negative	PMID:16969477	Kim M, Lee S, Yang SK, Song K, Lee I: Differential expression in histologically normal crypts of ulcerative colitis suggests primary crypt disorder. Oncol Rep. 2006 Oct;16(4):663-70. Ulcerative colitis is characterized by crypt infiltration particularly of neutrophils. However, it is not known whether it reflects a primary crypt disorder or a secondary inflammatory response. In this study, we analyzed the expression profiles of histologically normal crypts microdissected from formalin-fixed biopsies of early stage ulcerative colitis. Total RNAs were extracted, amplified, and applied to Affymetrix GeneChip (R) X3P Array. For the control, similar crypts from nonspecific colitis biopsies were applied. A total of 353 (4.3%) and 111 (1.4%) genes were > 3 times up-, and down-regulated in ulcerative colitis. Up-regulated genes included FCGBP (Fc fragment of IgG binding protein), cyclophilin A, chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 3, and genes associated with lipid metabolism. Down-regulated genes included APOA4 (apolipoprotein A-IV), cylindromatosis, BCL2-like 10, claudin 8, and numerous transcriptional regulators. FCGBP and APOA4 have been implicated in ulcerative colitis previously. Our data show differential expression in the crypt epithelia of ulcerative colitis before active inflammation is initiated, suggesting primary crypt abnormalities that might be implicated in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis.
Cylindromatosis	IkappaB-kinase	Negative	PMID:16301742	Zhou H, Monack DM, Kayagaki N, Wertz I, Yin J, Wolf B, Dixit VM: Yersinia virulence factor YopJ acts as a deubiquitinase to inhibit NF-kappa B activation. J Exp Med. 2005 Nov 21;202(10):1327-32. The bacterial pathogens of the genus Yersinia, the causative agents of plague, septicemia, and gastrointestinal syndromes, use a type III secretion system to inject virulence factors into host target cells. One virulence factor, YopJ, is essential for the death of infected macrophages and can block host proinflammatory responses by inhibiting both the nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, which might be important for evasion of the host immune response and aid in establishing a systemic infection. Here, we show that YopJ is a promiscuous deubiquitinating enzyme that negatively regulates signaling by removing ubiquitin moieties from critical proteins, such as TRAF2, TRAF6, and IkappaBalpha. In contrast to the cylindromatosis tumor suppressor CYLD, which attenuates NF-kappaB signaling by selectively removing K63-linked polyubiquitin chains that activate IkappaB kinase, YopJ also cleaves K48-linked chains and thereby inhibits proteasomal degradation of IkappaBalpha. YopJ, but not a catalytically inactive YopJ mutant, promoted deubiquitination of cellular proteins and cleaved both K48- and K63-linked polyubiquitin. Moreover, an in vitro assay was established to demonstrate directly the deubiquitinating activity of purified YopJ.

J Biol Chem. 2004 Aug 27;279(35):36171-4. Epub 2004 Jun 28. The transcription factor NF-kappaB regulates genes involved in inflammatory and immune responses, tumorigenesis, and apoptosis. In contrast to the pleiotropic stimuli that lead to its positive regulation, the known signaling mechanisms that underlie the negative regulation of NF-kappaB are very few. Recent studies have identified the tumor suppressor CYLD, loss of which causes a benign human syndrome called cylindromatosis, as a key negative regulator for NF-kappaB signaling by deubiquitinating tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor (TRAF) 2, TRAF6, and NEMO (NF-kappaB essential modulator, also known as IkappaB kinase gamma). However, how CYLD is regulated remains unknown. The present study revealed a novel autoregulatory feedback pathway through which activation of NF-kappaB by TNF-alpha and bacterium nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) induces CYLD that in turn leads to the negative regulation of NF-kappaB signaling. In addition, TRAF2 and TRAF6 appear to be differentially involved in NF-kappaB-dependent induction of CYLD by TNF-alpha and NTHi. These findings provide novel insights into the autoregulation of NF-kappaB activation.
Cylindromatosis	IkappaB-kinase	Negative	PMID:12917691	Kovalenko A, Chable-Bessia C, Cantarella G, Israel A, Wallach D, Courtois G: The tumour suppressor CYLD negatively regulates NF-kappaB signalling by deubiquitination. Nature. 2003 Aug 14;424(6950):801-5. NF-kappaB transcription factors have key roles in inflammation, immune response, oncogenesis and protection against apoptosis. In most cells, these factors are kept inactive in the cytoplasm through association with IkappaB inhibitors. After stimulation by various reagents, IkappaB is phosphorylated by the IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex and degraded by the proteasome, allowing NF-kappaB to translocate to the nucleus and activate its target genes. Here we report that CYLD, a tumour suppressor that is mutated in familial cylindromatosis, interacts with NEMO, the regulatory subunit of IKK. CYLD also interacts directly with tumour-necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)-associated factor 2 (TRAF2), an adaptor molecule involved in signalling by members of the family of TNF/nerve growth factor receptors. CYLD has deubiquitinating activity that is directed towards non-K48-linked polyubiquitin chains, and negatively modulates TRAF-mediated activation of IKK, strengthening the notion that ubiquitination is involved in IKK activation by TRAFs and suggesting that CYLD functions in this process. Truncations of CYLD found in cylindromatosis result in reduced enzymatic activity, indicating a link between impaired deubiquitination of CYLD substrates and human pathophysiology.

Cylindromatosis	toll-like-receptor-2	Negative	PMID:16230348	Yoshida H, Jono H, Kai H, Li JD: The tumor suppressor cylindromatosis (CYLD) acts as a negative regulator for toll-like receptor 2 signaling via negative cross-talk with TRAF6 AND TRAF7. J Biol Chem. 2005 Dec 9;280(49):41111-21. Epub 2005 Oct 17. Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) plays an important role in host defense against bacterial pathogens. Activation of TLR2 signaling not only induces the activation of innate immunity and instructs the development of the acquired immunity but also leads to the detrimental inflammatory responses in inflammatory and infectious diseases. To avoid detrimental inflammatory responses, TLR2 signaling must be tightly regulated. In contrast to the relative known positive regulation of TLR2 signaling, its negative regulation, however, is largely unknown. In addition the distal signaling components that link TLR2 to its downstream signaling pathways have yet to be further defined. In the present study we have provided direct evidence for the negative regulation of TLR2 signaling by the tumor suppressor cylindromatosis (CYLD). We showed that activation of TLR2 signaling by TLR2 ligands including peptidoglycan (PGN), MALP-2, and Pam3CSK4 induces activation of IKKs-IkappaBalpha and MKK3/6-p38 pathways not only by TRAF6 but also by TRAF7, a recently identified TRAF family member. The activation of both pathways leads to the transcription of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-8 as well as CYLD. CYLD in turn leads to the inhibition of TRAF6 and TRAF7 likely via a deubiquitination-dependent mechanism. The present studies thus unveil a novel autoregulatory feedback mechanism that negatively controls TLR2-IKKs-IkappaBalpha/MKK3/6-p38-NF-kappaB-dependent induction of immune and inflammatory responses via negatively cross-talking with both TRAF6 and TRAF7. These findings provide novel insights into autoregulation and negative regulation of TLR signaling.
Cylindromatosis	CYLD	Positive	PMID:17495026	Stegmeier F, Sowa ME, Nalepa G, Gygi SP, Harper JW, Elledge SJ: The tumor suppressor CYLD regulates entry into mitosis. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2007 May 22;104(21):8869-74. Epub 2007 May 10. Mutations in the cylindromatosis (CYLD) gene cause benign tumors of skin appendages, referred to as cylindromas. The CYLD gene encodes a deubiquitinating enzyme that removes Lys-63-linked ubiquitin chains from I kappa B kinase signaling components and thereby inhibits NF-kappaB pathway activation. The dysregulation of NF-kappaB activity has been proposed to promote cell transformation in part by increasing apoptosis resistance, but it is not clear whether this is CYLD's only or predominant tumor-suppressing function. Here, we show that CYLD is also required for timely entry into mitosis. Consistent with a cell-cycle regulatory function, CYLD localizes to microtubules in interphase and the midbody during telophase, and its protein levels decrease as cells exit from mitosis. We identified the protein kinase Plk1 as a potential target of CYLD in the regulation of mitotic entry, based on their physical interaction and similar loss-of-function and overexpression phenotypes. Our findings raise the possibility that, as with other genes regulating tumorigenesis, CYLD has not only tumor-suppressing (apoptosis regulation) but also tumor-promoting activities (enhancer of mitotic entry). We propose that this additional function of CYLD could provide an explanation for the benign nature of most cylindroma lesions.
Cylindromatosis	CYLD	Positive	PMID:16922728	Young AL, Kellermayer R, Szigeti R, Teszas A, Azmi S, Celebi JT: CYLD mutations underlie Brooke-Spiegler, familial cylindromatosis, and multiple familial trichoepithelioma syndromes. Clin Genet. 2006 Sep;70(3):246-9. Brooke-Spiegler syndrome (BSS), familial cylindromatosis (FC), and multiple familial trichoepithelioma (MFT), originally described as distinct inherited disorders, are characterized by a variety of skin appendage neoplasms. Mutations in the CYLD gene are found in individuals with these syndromes. We describe a single family with affected members exhibiting either the FC or the MFT phenotypes associated with a mutation in the CYLD gene. These findings support the notion that BSS, FC, and MFT represent phenotypic variation of a single defect. Of interest, one of the affected individuals described in this report exhibits a severe phenotype illustrating the morbidity of the disorder.
Cylindromatosis	CYLD	Positive	PMID:16135788	Wang L, Baiocchi RA, Pal S, Mosialos G, Caligiuri M, Sif S: The BRG1- and hBRM-associated factor BAF57 induces apoptosis by stimulating expression of the cylindromatosis tumor suppressor gene. Mol Cell Biol. 2005 Sep;25(18):7953-65. Mutation of BRG1, hBRM, and their associated factors, INI1 and BAF57, in primary human tumors has suggested that inactivation of human SWI/SNF (hSWI/SNF) complexes may be involved in neoplastic transformation. BT549 is an invasive human breast carcinoma cell line that lacks expression of BAF57, a key hSWI/SNF subunit that mediates interaction with transcriptional activators and corepressors. In this study we investigated the role of BAF57 in suppressing tumorigenesis by establishing BT549 stable cell lines that expresses full-length BAF57 protein. BT549 clones expressing BAF57 demonstrated marked phenotypic changes, slow growth kinetics, and restoration of contact inhibition. Altered growth was found to be due in part to cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis. Furthermore, microarray analysis revealed that BAF57-mediated cell death was associated with up-regulation of proapoptotic genes including the tumor suppressor familial cylindromatosis (CYLD), which was found to be a direct target of BAF57 as determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis. Increased expression of CYLD in BT549 cells induced apoptosis, while its suppression by small interfering RNA inhibited cell death in BAF57 expressing BT549 cells. These findings demonstrate the importance of BAF57 in cell growth regulation and provide a novel link between hSWI/SNF chromatin remodelers and apoptosis.

J Invest Dermatol. 2005 May;124(5):919-20. Brooke-Spiegler syndrome (BSS), familial cylindromatosis (FC), and multiple familial trichoepithelioma (MFT), originally described as distinct entities, share overlapping clinical findings. Patients with BSS are predisposed to multiple skin appendage tumors such as cylindroma, trichoepithelioma, and spiradenoma. FC, however, is characterized by cylindromas and MFT by trichoepitheliomas as the only tumor type. These disorders have recently been associated with mutations in the CYLD gene. In this report, we describe three families with BSS, one with FC, and two with MFT phenotypes associated with novel and recurrent mutations in CYLD. We provide evidence that these disorders represent phenotypic variation of a single entity and lack genotype-phenotype correlation.
Cylindromatosis	CYLD	Positive	PMID:15541090	Oiso N, Mizuno N, Fukai K, Nakagawa K, Ishii M: Mild phenotype of familial cylindromatosis associated with an R758X nonsense mutation in the CYLD tumour suppressor gene. Br J Dermatol. 2004 Nov;151(5):1084-6. Familial cylindromatosis is a rare dominantly inherited disease characterized by the development of multiple benign tumours of the skin appendages, including cylindromas, trichoepitheliomas and spiradenomas. The gene responsible was positionally cloned recently, and was designated CYLD. We describe a family with cylindromatosis, in which affected individuals have an inherited R758X nonsense mutation of CYLD. Affected members of this family manifest a relatively mild tumour phenotype; the largest tumour was only 30 mm in diameter. Thus far, there is no evident genotype-phenotype relationship in cylindromatosis, although the number of families reported with both phenotypic and genotypic data remains small.
Cylindromatosis	CYLD	Positive	PMID:15086550	Zhang XJ, Liang YH, He PP, Yang S, Wang HY, Chen JJ, Yuan WT, Xu SJ, Cui Y, Huang W: Identification of the cylindromatosis tumor-suppressor gene responsible for multiple familial trichoepithelioma. J Invest Dermatol. 2004 Mar;122(3):658-64. Multiple familial trichoepithelioma (MFT) is an autosomal dominant skin disease characterized by the presence of many small benign tumors with pilar differentiation predominantly on the face. The first locus has been previously mapped to chromosome 9p21, but no gene for MFT has been identified to date. To identify the disease gene in a large Chinese family, we initially performed linkage analysis with microsatellite markers from 9p21, but failed to confirm the linkage to this region. Previous publications showed MFT and familial cylindromatosis (FC) can occur within one family and in a single person. Therefore, we speculated that the cylindromatosis gene (CYLDI gene) responsible for FC may be related to the pathogenesis of MFT. In view of that, we genotyped all available individuals using 11 microsatellite markers spanning the CYLDI gene region at 16q12-q13. We identified the linkage of MFT to this region. Mutation analysis in the CYLDI gene detected a frameshift mutation, designated as c.2355-2358delCAGA. The study firstly identified the cylindromatosis gene responsible for MFT and showed that different mutations of the CYLDI gene can give rise to distinct clinical and histological expression such as FC and MFT.
Cylindromatosis	CYLD	Positive	PMID:14585643	Wall NR, Shi Y: Small RNA: can RNA interference be exploited for therapy? . Lancet. 2003 Oct 25;362(9393):1401-3. CONTEXT: RNA interference (RNAi) is the sequence-specific gene-silencing induced by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), and gives information about gene function quickly, easily, and inexpensively. The use of RNAi for genetic-based therapies is widely studied, especially in viral infections, cancers, and inherited genetic disorders. RNAi has been used to make tissue-specific knockdown mice for studying gene function in a whole animal. Combined with genomics data, RNAi-directed gene-silencing could allow functional determination of any gene expressed in a cell or pathway. The term RNAi came from the discovery that the injection of dsRNAs into Caenorhabditis elegans interferes with the expression of specific genes containing a complementary region to the delivered dsRNA. Although stalled for a time by the non-gene-specific interferon response elicited by dsRNA molecules longer than about 30 nucleotides in mammalian cells, Tom Tuschl's group found that transfection of synthetic 21-nucleotide small-interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes were highly selective and sequence-specific inhibitors of endogenous genes. STARTING POINT: siRNA expression has been studied with siRNA from plasmid and viral vectors that efficiently deliver siRNAs into both dividing and non-dividing cells, stem cells, zygotes, and their differentiated progeny. A collection of RNA interference vectors that suppress 50 human de-ubiquitinating enzymes allowed Thijn Brummelkamp and colleagues to study this gene family and to identify de-ubiquitinating enzymes in cancer-relevant pathways (Nature 2003; 424: 797-801). These researchers found that the familial cylindromatosis tumour suppressor gene (CYLD), previously of unknown function, could enhance the activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB, leading to increased resistance to apoptosis. They have now started to investigate the use of CYLD inhibitors in clinical trials. WHERE NEXT: The ability to efficiently and stably produce and deliver sufficient amounts of siRNA to the proper target tissues require refinement before this new technology can be tried clinically. Initial in-vivo studies reported effective transgene suppression in adult mice by chemically synthesised siRNAs. More recently many researchers have used plasmid and viral vectors for transcription of short-hairpin RNAs, both in vitro and in vivo. With these expression systems, gene expression was more stably inhibited than with the transient knockdown recorded with chemically synthesised siRNA. Human trials exploiting these latest findings are likely to soon follow.

Nature. 2003 Aug 14;424(6950):797-801. Protein modification by the conjugation of ubiquitin moieties--ubiquitination--plays a major part in many biological processes, including cell cycle and apoptosis. The enzymes that mediate ubiquitin-conjugation have been well-studied, but much less is known about the ubiquitin-specific proteases that mediate de-ubiquitination of cellular substrates. To study this gene family, we designed a collection of RNA interference vectors to suppress 50 human de-ubiquitinating enzymes, and used these vectors to identify de-ubiquitinating enzymes in cancer-relevant pathways. We report here that inhibition of one of these enzymes, the familial cylindromatosis tumour suppressor gene (CYLD), having no known function, enhances activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB. We show that CYLD binds to the NEMO (also known as IKKgamma) component of the IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex, and appears to regulate its activity through de-ubiquitination of TRAF2, as TRAF2 ubiquitination can be modulated by CYLD. Inhibition of CYLD increases resistance to apoptosis, suggesting a mechanism through which loss of CYLD contributes to oncogenesis. We show that this effect can be relieved by aspirin derivatives that inhibit NF-kappaB activity, which suggests a therapeutic intervention strategy to restore growth control in patients suffering from familial cylindromatosis.
Cylindromatosis	CYLD	Positive	PMID:12917689	Trompouki E, Hatzivassiliou E, Tsichritzis T, Farmer H, Ashworth A, Mosialos G: CYLD is a deubiquitinating enzyme that negatively regulates NF-kappaB activation by TNFR family members. Nature. 2003 Aug 14;424(6950):793-6. Familial cylindromatosis is an autosomal dominant predisposition to tumours of skin appendages called cylindromas. Familial cylindromatosis is caused by mutations in a gene encoding the CYLD protein of previously unknown function. Here we show that CYLD is a deubiquitinating enzyme that negatively regulates activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB by specific tumour-necrosis factor receptors (TNFRs). Loss of the deubiquitinating activity of CYLD correlates with tumorigenesis. CYLD inhibits activation of NF-kappaB by the TNFR family members CD40, XEDAR and EDAR in a manner that depends on the deubiquitinating activity of CYLD. Downregulation of CYLD by RNA-mediated interference augments both basal and CD40-mediated activation of NF-kappaB. The inhibition of NF-kappaB activation by CYLD is mediated, at least in part, by the deubiquitination and inactivation of TNFR-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) and, to a lesser extent, TRAF6. These results indicate that CYLD is a negative regulator of the cytokine-mediated activation of NF-kappaB that is required for appropriate cellular homeostasis of skin appendages.

In this study we investigated the role of BAF57 in suppressing tumorigenesis by establishing BT549 stable cell lines that expresses full-length BAF57 protein. BT549 clones expressing BAF57 demonstrated marked phenotypic changes, slow growth kinetics, and restoration of contact inhibition. Altered growth was found to be due in part to cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis. Furthermore, microarray analysis revealed that BAF57-mediated cell death was associated with up-regulation of proapoptotic genes including the tumor suppressor familial cylindromatosis (CYLD), which was found to be a direct target of BAF57 as determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis. Increased expression of CYLD in BT549 cells induced apoptosis, while its suppression by small interfering RNA inhibited cell death in BAF57 expressing BT549 cells. These findings demonstrate the importance of BAF57 in cell growth regulation and provide a novel link between hSWI/SNF chromatin remodelers and apoptosis.
Cylindromatosis	integrin	Negative	PMID:12714041	Aumailley M, El Khal A, Knoss N, Tunggal L: Laminin 5 processing and its integration into the ECM. . Matrix Biol. 2003 Mar;22(1):49-54. Laminins are a family of multi-functional basement membrane proteins. Their C-terminal domain binds to cell surface receptors and is thereby responsible for cell anchorage and the initiation of specific outside-in and inside-out signals. With their N-terminal parts, laminins interact with proteins of the extracellular matrix scaffold to secure the basement membrane to the underlying mesenchymal tissue. Laminins 5A (alpha3Abeta3gamma2), 5B (alpha3Bbeta3gamma2) and 6 (alpha3Abeta1gamma1) are isoforms specific of the basement membrane underneath the epidermis and they undergo a sequential series of extracellular proteolytic changes, which might successively turn on and off one or several of their biological and mechanical functions. Under physiological conditions, such as in adult human skin, epithelial laminins have lost part of the C- and N-terminal domains of the alpha3 and gamma2 chains, respectively. In contrast, in cylindromatosis, a rare inherited disease characterised by major ultrastructural alterations of the basement membrane and altered expression/distribution of integrin receptors, laminin processing has not been completed. Together, these results suggest that laminin processing may regulate signalling pathways and the architecture of the basement membrane by restricting the repertoire of interactions with cell surface receptors and extracellular matrix components.
Cylindromatosis	ubiquitin	Positive	PMID:16301742	Zhou H, Monack DM, Kayagaki N, Wertz I, Yin J, Wolf B, Dixit VM: Yersinia virulence factor YopJ acts as a deubiquitinase to inhibit NF-kappa B activation. J Exp Med. 2005 Nov 21;202(10):1327-32. The bacterial pathogens of the genus Yersinia, the causative agents of plague, septicemia, and gastrointestinal syndromes, use a type III secretion system to inject virulence factors into host target cells. One virulence factor, YopJ, is essential for the death of infected macrophages and can block host proinflammatory responses by inhibiting both the nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, which might be important for evasion of the host immune response and aid in establishing a systemic infection. Here, we show that YopJ is a promiscuous deubiquitinating enzyme that negatively regulates signaling by removing ubiquitin moieties from critical proteins, such as TRAF2, TRAF6, and IkappaBalpha. In contrast to the cylindromatosis tumor suppressor CYLD, which attenuates NF-kappaB signaling by selectively removing K63-linked polyubiquitin chains that activate IkappaB kinase, YopJ also cleaves K48-linked chains and thereby inhibits proteasomal degradation of IkappaBalpha. YopJ, but not a catalytically inactive YopJ mutant, promoted deubiquitination of cellular proteins and cleaved both K48- and K63-linked polyubiquitin. Moreover, an in vitro assay was established to demonstrate directly the deubiquitinating activity of purified YopJ.
Cylindromatosis	CDH11	Negative	PMID:16107186	Costello CM, Mah N, Hasler R, Rosenstiel P, Waetzig GH, Hahn A, Lu T, Gurbuz Y, Nikolaus S, Albrecht M, Hampe J, Lucius R, Kloppel G, Eickhoff H, Lehrach H, Lengauer T, Schreiber S: Dissection of the inflammatory bowel disease transcriptome using genome-wide cDNA microarrays. PLoS Med. 2005 Aug;2(8):e199. Epub 2005 Aug 23. BACKGROUND: The differential pathophysiologic mechanisms that trigger and maintain the two forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn disease (CD), and ulcerative colitis (UC) are only partially understood. cDNA microarrays can be used to decipher gene regulation events at a genome-wide level and to identify novel unknown genes that might be involved in perpetuating inflammatory disease progression. METHODS AND FINDINGS: High-density cDNA microarrays representing 33,792 UniGene clusters were prepared. Biopsies were taken from the sigmoid colon of normal controls (n = 11), CD patients (n = 10) and UC patients (n = 10). 33P-radiolabeled cDNA from purified poly (A)+ RNA extracted from biopsies (unpooled) was hybridized to the arrays. We identified 500 and 272 transcripts differentially regulated in CD and UC, respectively. Interesting hits were independently verified by real-time PCR in a second sample of 100 individuals, and immunohistochemistry was used for exemplary localization. The main findings point to novel molecules important in abnormal immune regulation and the highly disturbed cell biology of colonic epithelial cells in IBD pathogenesis, e.g., CYLD (cylindromatosis, turban tumor syndrome) and CDH11 (cadherin 11, type 2). By the nature of the array setup, many of the genes identified were to our knowledge previously uncharacterized, and prediction of the putative function of a subsection of these genes indicate that some could be involved in early events in disease pathophysiology. CONCLUSION: A comprehensive set of candidate genes not previously associated with IBD was revealed, which underlines the polygenic and complex nature of the disease. It points out substantial differences in pathophysiology between CD and UC. The multiple unknown genes identified may stimulate new research in the fields of barrier mechanisms and cell signalling in the context of IBD, and ultimately new therapeutic approaches.

Cylindromatosis	NEMO	Negative	PMID:15226292	Jono H, Lim JH, Chen LF, Xu H, Trompouki E, Pan ZK, Mosialos G, Li JD: NF-kappaB is essential for induction of CYLD, the negative regulator of NF-kappaB: evidence for a novel inducible autoregulatory feedback pathway. J Biol Chem. 2004 Aug 27;279(35):36171-4. Epub 2004 Jun 28. The transcription factor NF-kappaB regulates genes involved in inflammatory and immune responses, tumorigenesis, and apoptosis. In contrast to the pleiotropic stimuli that lead to its positive regulation, the known signaling mechanisms that underlie the negative regulation of NF-kappaB are very few. Recent studies have identified the tumor suppressor CYLD, loss of which causes a benign human syndrome called cylindromatosis, as a key negative regulator for NF-kappaB signaling by deubiquitinating tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor (TRAF) 2, TRAF6, and NEMO (NF-kappaB essential modulator, also known as IkappaB kinase gamma). However, how CYLD is regulated remains unknown. The present study revealed a novel autoregulatory feedback pathway through which activation of NF-kappaB by TNF-alpha and bacterium nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) induces CYLD that in turn leads to the negative regulation of NF-kappaB signaling. In addition, TRAF2 and TRAF6 appear to be differentially involved in NF-kappaB-dependent induction of CYLD by TNF-alpha and NTHi. These findings provide novel insights into the autoregulation of NF-kappaB activation.
Cylindromatosis	NEMO	Negative	PMID:12917691	Kovalenko A, Chable-Bessia C, Cantarella G, Israel A, Wallach D, Courtois G: The tumour suppressor CYLD negatively regulates NF-kappaB signalling by deubiquitination. Nature. 2003 Aug 14;424(6950):801-5. NF-kappaB transcription factors have key roles in inflammation, immune response, oncogenesis and protection against apoptosis. In most cells, these factors are kept inactive in the cytoplasm through association with IkappaB inhibitors. After stimulation by various reagents, IkappaB is phosphorylated by the IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex and degraded by the proteasome, allowing NF-kappaB to translocate to the nucleus and activate its target genes. Here we report that CYLD, a tumour suppressor that is mutated in familial cylindromatosis, interacts with NEMO, the regulatory subunit of IKK. CYLD also interacts directly with tumour-necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)-associated factor 2 (TRAF2), an adaptor molecule involved in signalling by members of the family of TNF/nerve growth factor receptors. CYLD has deubiquitinating activity that is directed towards non-K48-linked polyubiquitin chains, and negatively modulates TRAF-mediated activation of IKK, strengthening the notion that ubiquitination is involved in IKK activation by TRAFs and suggesting that CYLD functions in this process. Truncations of CYLD found in cylindromatosis result in reduced enzymatic activity, indicating a link between impaired deubiquitination of CYLD substrates and human pathophysiology.

Cylindromatosis	activating-transcription-factor-3	Negative	PMID:17043644	Zhong S, Fields CR, Su N, Pan YX, Robertson KD: Pharmacologic inhibition of epigenetic modifications, coupled with gene expression profiling, reveals novel targets of aberrant DNA methylation and histone deacetylation in lung cancer. Oncogene. 2007 Apr 19;26(18):2621-34. Epub 2006 Oct 9. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States due, in large part, to the lack of early detection methods. Lung cancer arises from a complex series of genetic and epigenetic changes leading to uncontrolled cell growth and metastasis. Unlike genetic changes, epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation and histone acetylation, are reversible with currently available pharmaceuticals and are early events in lung tumorigenesis detectable by non-invasive methods. In order to better understand how epigenetic changes contribute to lung cancer, and to identify new disease biomarkers, we combined pharmacologic inhibition of DNA methylation and histone deacetylation in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines, with genome-wide expression profiling. Of the more than 200 genes upregulated by these treatments, three of these, neuronatin, metallothionein 3 and cystatin E/M, were frequently hypermethylated and transcriptionally downregulated in NSCLC cell lines and tumors. Interestingly, four other genes, cylindromatosis, CD9, activating transcription factor 3 and oxytocin receptor, were dominantly regulated by histone deacetylation and were also frequently downregulated in lung tumors. The majority of these genes also suppressed NSCLC growth in culture when ectopically expressed. This study therefore reveals new putative NSCLC growth regulatory genes and epigenetic disease biomarkers that may enhance early detection strategies and serve as therapeutic targets.

Cylindromatosis	claudin-8	Negative	PMID:16969477	Kim M, Lee S, Yang SK, Song K, Lee I: Differential expression in histologically normal crypts of ulcerative colitis suggests primary crypt disorder. Oncol Rep. 2006 Oct;16(4):663-70. Ulcerative colitis is characterized by crypt infiltration particularly of neutrophils. However, it is not known whether it reflects a primary crypt disorder or a secondary inflammatory response. In this study, we analyzed the expression profiles of histologically normal crypts microdissected from formalin-fixed biopsies of early stage ulcerative colitis. Total RNAs were extracted, amplified, and applied to Affymetrix GeneChip (R) X3P Array. For the control, similar crypts from nonspecific colitis biopsies were applied. A total of 353 (4.3%) and 111 (1.4%) genes were > 3 times up-, and down-regulated in ulcerative colitis. Up-regulated genes included FCGBP (Fc fragment of IgG binding protein), cyclophilin A, chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 3, and genes associated with lipid metabolism. Down-regulated genes included APOA4 (apolipoprotein A-IV), cylindromatosis, BCL2-like 10, claudin 8, and numerous transcriptional regulators. FCGBP and APOA4 have been implicated in ulcerative colitis previously. Our data show differential expression in the crypt epithelia of ulcerative colitis before active inflammation is initiated, suggesting primary crypt abnormalities that might be implicated in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis.
Gilbert_syndrome	N-acetyltransferase	Negative	PMID:16402080	Hermann R, Borlak J, Munzel U, Niebch G, Fuhr U, Maus J, Erb K: The role of Gilbert's syndrome and frequent NAT2 slow acetylation polymorphisms in the pharmacokinetics of retigabine. Pharmacogenomics J. 2006 May-Jun;6(3):211-9. Retigabine (RGB) is an investigational antiepileptic drug, which undergoes extensive UGT1A1, 1A9 and 1A4-mediated N-glucuronidation and N-acetylation. The mono-acetylated metabolite of RGB has some pharmacological activity and is denoted AWD21-360. We investigated whether the pharmacokinetics (PK) of RGB and AWD21-360 are altered in subjects with Gilbert's syndrome (GS) and/or with frequent N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) slow acetylator (SA) polymorphisms. Based on consistent genotyping and phenotyping screening results, 37 Caucasian subjects (21-46 years; 31 men, six women) were assigned to one of the following groups: (1) absence of GS (non-GS)/rapid acetylator (RA) (N=11); (2) GS/RA (N=8); (3) non-GS/SA (N=11); (4) GS/SA (N=7). Subjects received single and multiple (b.i.d.) 200-mg oral RGB doses over 5 days. Blood samples were collected up to 60 h after dosing for plasma PK of RGB and AWD21-360. Group comparisons were performed by ANOVA. Single-dose PK of RGB and AWD21-360 and multiple-dose PK of RGB did not differ significantly between groups. After multiple dose treatment, RA subjects showed a significantly higher total exposure to AWD21-360 of about 32% (95% CI 101.9-172.5) relative to SA subjects (P=0.0362). The UGT1A1 metabolic capacity (i.e. presence or absence of GS), however, did not significantly affect the overall exposure to AWD21-360. The results indicate that the PK of RGB is unaltered in individuals with GS, in subjects with NAT2 SA status, and in carriers of both variants, whereas the total exposure to AWD21-360 is significantly related to the RA or SA status of subjects. Results further suggest that metabolic switching to the mono-acetylated metabolite AWD21-360 may partially compensate for the impaired glucuronidation capacity in GS subjects. RGB treatment showed no significant differences in tolerability and safety between groups.
Gilbert_syndrome	paraoxonase	Negative	PMID:8361990	Daly AK, Cholerton S, Gregory W, Idle JR: Metabolic polymorphisms. Pharmacol Ther. 1993 Feb-Mar;57(2-3):129-60. Polymorphisms have been detected in a variety of xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes at both the phenotypic and genotypic level. In the case of four enzymes, the cytochrome P450 CYP2D6, glutathione S-transferase mu, N-acetyltransferase 2 and serum cholinesterase, the majority of mutations which give rise to a defective phenotype have now been identified. Another group of enzymes show definite polymorphism at the phenotypic level but the exact genetic mechanisms responsible are not yet clear. These enzymes include the cytochromes P450 CYP1A1, CYP1A2 and a CYP2C form which metabolizes mephenytoin, a flavin-linked monooxygenase (fish-odour syndrome), paraoxonase, UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (Gilbert's syndrome) and thiopurine S-methyltransferase. In the case of a further group of enzymes, there is some evidence for polymorphism at either the phenotypic or genotypic level but this has not been unambiguously demonstrated. Examples of this class include the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2A6, CYP2E1, CYP2C9 and CYP3A4, xanthine oxidase, an S-oxidase which metabolizes carbocysteine, epoxide hydrolase, two forms of sulphotransferase and several methyltransferases. The nature of all these polymorphisms and possible polymorphisms is discussed in detail, with particular reference to the effects of this variation on drug metabolism and susceptibility to chemically-induced diseases.

J Clin Pathol. 1990 Feb;43(2):125-8. Investigation of mild, inherited increased serum alkaline phosphatase activity partially combined with Gilbert's syndrome in one family showed, apart from a normal liver fraction, an intestinal isoenzyme pattern and an extra band in the agar electrophoresis. Analysis by agarose electrophoresis before and after incubation of neuraminidase showed that the extra fraction was an intestinal variant isoenzyme. The precise genetic background of the two disorders in this family could not be determined from the available data. Abnormal activities of (regular) intestinal alkaline phosphatase isoenzyme caused the increase in serum alkaline phosphatase in the absence of disease.
Gilbert_syndrome	UDP-glucuronosyltransferase	Positive	PMID:17196409	Ostanek B, Furlan D, Mavec T, Lukac-Bajalo J: UGT1A1 (TA) n promoter polymorphism--a new case of a (TA) 8 allele in Caucasians. Blood Cells Mol Dis. 2007 Mar-Apr;38(2):78-82. Epub 2006 Dec 28. Gilbert's syndrome is a mild hereditary unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia caused by mutations in the bilirubin UDP-glucuronosyltransferase gene (UGT1A1). The causative mutation in Caucasians is almost exclusively a TA dinucleotide insertion in the TATA box of the UGT1A1 promoter. Affected individuals are homozygous for the variant promoter and have 7 instead of 6 TA repeats. The aim of the present study was to determine the genotypes of UGT1A1 (TA) n promoter polymorphism in the healthy Slovenian population and to investigate the association of genotypes with serum bilirubin levels. 236 healthy subjects were genotyped by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis, which was validated by sequence analysis. The frequencies of genotypes were as follows: (TA)(6/6) (38.1%), (TA)(6/7) (47.9%), (TA)(7/7) (13.6%). There was a statistically significant association of genotypes with serum bilirubin levels (p bilirubin levels. One individual in the group had the rare genotype (TA)(7/8) (0.4%). Analysis of his family showed the following genotypes: (TA)(6/8) in his father and sister and (TA)(7/8) in his two brothers. In conclusion, the frequency of UGT1A1 (TA) n promoter polymorphism genotypes was determined for the first time in the Slovenian population and is similar to frequencies observed in other Caucasian populations. The extremely rare (TA) 8 allele in Caucasians was found also in Slovenians.
Gilbert_syndrome	UDP-glucuronosyltransferase	Positive	PMID:17058217	Lankisch TO, Moebius U, Wehmeier M, Behrens G, Manns MP, Schmidt RE, Strassburg CP: Gilbert's disease and atazanavir: from phenotype to UDP-glucuronosyltransferase haplotype. Hepatology. 2006 Nov;44(5):1324-32. Gilbert's disease leads to intermittent non-hemolytic hyperbilirubinemia by a reduction of hepatic bilirubin glucuronidation associated with the presence of the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1*28 polymorphism. It is considered benign because it does not result in hepatocellular damage. However, pharmacogenetic analyses have linked UGT1A1*28 to drug toxicity and cancer predisposition. The protease inhibitor atazanavir (ATV) is an inhibitor of hepatic UGT activity leading to hyperbilirubinemia in individual patients. Whether this is linked specifically to UGT1A1*28 or to more complex variants influencing glucuronidation is unclear. One hundred and six ATV-treated patients were characterized and genotyped for UGT1A1*28, the UGT1A3 (-66C) and UGT1A7 (-57G) promoter variants, and UGT1A7 (129K/131K). ATV treatment increased median bilirubin levels from 10 to 41 micromol/L (P = .001) with hyperbilirubinemia exceeding 43 micromol/L in 37%. Hyperbilirubinemia over 43 micromol/L was significantly associated not only with UGT1A1*28 but also with UGT1A3-66C, UGT1A7-57G, and UGT1A7 (129K/131K), although these variants do not naturally occur in linkage dysequilibrium in blood donors. Homozygous combinations of UGT1A1*28 with the other variants increased from 7.4% (normal bilirubin to 42 micromol/L) to 41% to 46.1% (43 to > 85 micromol/L), and 100% (> 85 micromol/L). All six patients with hyperbilirubinemia greater than 85 micromol/L were homozygous for all four variants identifying a haplotype inherited on a single allele. In conclusion, the genetic variant associated with Gilbert's disease is identified as part of a haplotype of four UGT1A variants spanning three genes at the UGT1A gene locus. This haplotype predisposes to hyperbilirubinemia in ATV treatment and may have an additional role as a pharmacogenomic risk factor for drug therapy.
Gilbert_syndrome	UDP-glucuronosyltransferase	Positive	PMID:16610035	Farheen S, Sengupta S, Santra A, Pal S, Dhali GK, Chakravorty M, Majumder PP, Chowdhury A: Gilbert's syndrome: High frequency of the (TA) 7 TAA allele in India and its interaction with a novel CAT insertion in promoter of the gene for bilirubin UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1 gene. World J Gastroenterol. 2006 Apr 14;12(14):2269-75. AIM: To identify the variants in UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1 (UGT1A1) gene in Gilbert's syndrome (GS) and to estimate the association between homozygosity for TA insertion and GS in India, as well as the frequency of TA insertion and its impact among normal controls in India. METHODS: Ninety-five GS cases and 95 normal controls were selected. Liver function and other tests were done. The promoter and all 5 exons of UGT1A1 gene were resequenced. Functional assessment of a novel trinucleotide insertion was done by in silico analysis and by estimating UGT1A1 promoter activity carried out by luciferase reporter assay of appropriate constructs in Hep G2 cell line. RESULTS: Among the GS patients, 80% were homozygous for the TA insertion, which was several-fold higher than reports from other ethnic groups. The mean UCB level was elevated among individuals with only one copy of this insertion, which was not significantly different from those with two copies. Many new DNA variants in UGT1A1 gene were discovered, including a trinucleotide (CAT) insertion in the promoter found in a subset (10%) of GS patients, but not among normal controls. In-silico analysis showed marked changes in the DNA-folding of the promoter and functional analysis showed a 20-fold reduction in transcription efficiency of UGT1A1 gene resulting from this insertion, thereby significantly elevating the UCB level. CONCLUSION: The genetic epidemiology of GS is variable across ethnic groups and the epistatic interactions among UGT1A1 promoter variants modulate bilirubin glucuronidation.

Gilbert_syndrome	UDP-glucuronosyltransferase	Positive	PMID:15378351	Maruo Y, D'Addario C, Mori A, Iwai M, Takahashi H, Sato H, Takeuchi Y: Two linked polymorphic mutations (A (TA) 7TAA and T-3279G) of UGT1A1 as the principal cause of Gilbert syndrome. Hum Genet. 2004 Nov;115(6):525-6. Epub 2004 Sep 17. Gilbert syndrome is a mild hereditary unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia caused by mutations in the bilirubin UDP-glucuronosyltransferase gene (UGT1A1). The mutation, A (TA) 7TAA, is thought to be the sole cause of the syndrome in Caucasians, but an enhancer polymorphism (T-3279G) that lowers transcriptional activity has recently been reported. We have tested the linkage of the two mutations in 11 Caucasians and 12 Japanese patients who were homozygous for A (TA) 7TAA. All 23 patients were also homozygous for T-3279G, indicating that T-3279G and A (TA) 7TAA were linked. The decrease in transcription caused by both mutations together may be essential to the syndrome.
Gilbert_syndrome	UDP-glucuronosyltransferase	Positive	PMID:14616765	Maruo Y, Poon KK, Ito M, Iwai M, Takahashi H, Mori A, Sato H, Takeuchi Y: Co-occurrence of three different mutations in the bilirubin UDP-glucuronosyltransferase gene in a Chinese family with Crigler-Najjar syndrome type I and Gilbert's syndrome. Clin Genet. 2003 Nov;64(5):420-3. Crigler-Najjar syndrome type I is a severe form of hereditary unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia and is caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations of the bilirubin UDP-glucuronosyltransferase gene (UGT1A1). We analyzed the bilirubin UDP-glucuronosyltransferase gene in a female Chinese patient with Crigler-Najjar syndrome type I. Relatives of the patient were also analyzed. The patient was homozygous for a nonsense mutation of R341X. The patient's father, sister and brother, all diagnosed with Gilbert's syndrome, were compound heterozygotes of R341X, P229Q, and an insertion mutation of the TATA box [A (TA) 7TAA]. Heterozygotes of nonsense mutations (Q331X and C280X) in our previous study had either Crigler-Najjar syndrome type II or Gilbert's syndrome, but heterozygotes of R341X (mother and grandmothers) were normal. An in vitro expression study of homozygous and heterozygous models of R341X showed 0 and 58%, respectively, of normal enzyme activity. Therefore, the present results indicate that carriers of the nonsense mutation could be normal for plasma bilirubin concentration, Gilbert's syndrome and Crigler-Najjar syndrome type II. The results also suggest the importance of the accumulation of prevalent or polymorphic mutation in the etiology of Gilbert's syndrome and Crigler-Najjar syndrome type II.
Gilbert_syndrome	UDP-glucuronosyltransferase	Positive	PMID:12732365	Kohle C, Mohrle B, Munzel PA, Schwab M, Wernet D, Badary OA, Bock KW: Frequent co-occurrence of the TATA box mutation associated with Gilbert's syndrome (UGT1A1*28) with other polymorphisms of the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase-1 locus (UGT1A6*2 and UGT1A7*3) in Caucasians and Egyptians. Biochem Pharmacol. 2003 May 1;65(9):1521-7. Polymorphisms of drug metabolizing enzymes are frequently associated with diseases and side effects of drugs. Recently, a TATA box mutation of UGT1A1 (UGT1A1*28), a common genotype leading to Gilbert's syndrome, and several missense mutations of other UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1 (UGT1) family members have been described. Furthermore, co-occurrence of UGT1A1*28 and UGT1A6*2 has been observed. In order to elucidate the basis for co-occurrence of UGT1 mutations, fluorescence resonance energy transfer techniques were developed for rapid determination of polymorphisms of three UGT isoforms (UGT1A1*28, 1A6*2, and 1A7*2/*3). Hundred healthy Caucasians and 50 Egyptians were genotyped. All genotypes followed the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Only three major haplotypes were found, including a haplotype consisting of allelic variants of all three isoforms (29% in Caucasians and 22% in Egyptians), all leading to reduced UGT activity. Frequent haplotypes containing several UGT1 allelic variants should be taken into account in studies on the association between diseases, abnormal drug reactions, and UGT1 family polymorphisms.
Gilbert_syndrome	UDP-glucuronosyltransferase	Positive	PMID:12499798	Kim YH, Yeon JE, Jung GM, Kim HJ, Kim JS, Byun KS, Bak YT, Lee CH: [A study of polymorphism in UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1 (UGT-1A1) promoter gene in Korean patients with Gilbert's syndrome]. Taehan Kan Hakhoe Chi. 2002 Jun;8(2):132-8. BACKGROUND/AIMS: Hepatic glucuronidating activity, essential for efficient biliary excretion of bilirubin, is reduced to about 30 percent of normal in patients with Gilbert's syndrome. Patients with Gilbert's syndrome have an additional TA insertion in the A (TA) TAA of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1 (UGT-1A1) promoter gene. This results in reduced frequency and accuracy of transcription initiation and enzyme activity. The frequency and location of the mutation vary according to races. This study was done to determine the UGT-1A1 promoter gene mutation in Korean cases of Gilbert's syndrome. METHODS: Promoter regions of the gene for bilirubin UGT-1A1 in twelve patients with Gilbert's syndrome and twenty healthy subjects (controls) were sequenced. RESULTS: 1) Among twelve Gilbert's syndrome five patients were homozygous for A (TA) 6/6TAA, two were homozygous for A (TA) 7/7TAA, and the other five were heterozygous for A (TA) 6/7TAA. The prevalence of A (TA) TAA mutation was 58.3 percent. 2) Among twenty healthy subjects seventeen were homozygous for A (TA) 6/6TAA, one was homozygous for A (TA) 7/7TAA, and two were heterozygous for A (TA) 6/7TAA. The prevalence of A (TA) TAA mutation was 15 percent. 3) The prevalence of A (TA) TAA mutation in Gilbert's syndrome patients was significantly higher than in the controls (p=0.018). CONCLUSION: Although the prevalence of A (TA) TAA mutation in Korean patients with Gilbert's syndrome is significantly higher than in the controls, the mutations of the promoter region of UGT-1A1 gene appear not to be the main or sole cause in Gilbert's syndrome in Korea since the prevalence of A (TA) TAA mutation is not so high. Further studies to determine the relationship between other UGT-1A1 gene mutation and Gilbert's syndrome in Korea are needed.
Gilbert_syndrome	UDP-glucuronosyltransferase	Positive	PMID:12166768	Chen YC, Chiou TJ, Yang MH, Yu IT: Two easy-to-perform diagnostic tests for Gilbert's syndrome. Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi. 2002 May;65(5):231-4. Gilbert's syndrome is a benign, often familial condition characterized by asymptomatic jaundice. A patient suffering from Gilbert's syndrome may have hepatic activity of bilirubin-UDP-glucuronosyltransferase decreasing to levels around 30% of the normal. A clinical diagnosis of Gilbert's syndrome is usually followed in case of mild hyperbilirubinemia with a high fraction of unconjugated bilirubin, normal values of liver enzymes, and no overt signs of hemolysis. This article reported a 17-year-old male with only partial indication of indirect hyperbilirubinemia. Rifampicin test and caloric restriction test were applied to assure the patient had Gilbert's syndrome. These two non-invasive diagnostic means, with the benefit of avoiding hazardous liver biopsy, are gaining popularity in our routine Gilbert's syndrome examination.

Blood Cells Mol Dis. 2002 Mar-Apr;28(2):104-7. A patient with chronic hemolytic anemia and G6PD deficiency was noted to be severely jaundiced and to have a high serum ferritin level. Analysis of his DNA revealed only heterozygosity for the c.187 C--> G (H63D) mutation of HFE, but showed that he was homozygous for the UDP glucuronosyltransferase promoter mutation of Gilbert's disease and that he had a previously undescribed mutation of G6PD, c.832 T--> C (Ser278Pro). The new variant was named G6PD La Jolla.
Gilbert_syndrome	intestinal-alkaline-phosphatase	Positive	PMID:2318988	Lieverse AG, van Essen GG, Beukeveld GJ, Gazendam J, Dompeling EC, ten Kate LP, van Belle SA, Weits J: Familial increased serum intestinal alkaline phosphatase: a new variant associated with Gilbert's syndrome. J Clin Pathol. 1990 Feb;43(2):125-8. Investigation of mild, inherited increased serum alkaline phosphatase activity partially combined with Gilbert's syndrome in one family showed, apart from a normal liver fraction, an intestinal isoenzyme pattern and an extra band in the agar electrophoresis. Analysis by agarose electrophoresis before and after incubation of neuraminidase showed that the extra fraction was an intestinal variant isoenzyme. The precise genetic background of the two disorders in this family could not be determined from the available data. Abnormal activities of (regular) intestinal alkaline phosphatase isoenzyme caused the increase in serum alkaline phosphatase in the absence of disease.
Gilbert_syndrome	UDPGT	Positive	PMID:16498946	Mammaev SN: [Molecular diagnosis of heritable unconjugated hyperbilirubinemias] . Klin Lab Diagn. 2005 Dec;(12):8-13. There is considerable evidence suggesting that genetic damages to human uridine diphosphate glucuronyltransferase (UDPGT) gene located on clhromosome 2q37 are responsible for hereditary unconjugated hyperbilirubinemias (HUHB). The Crigler-Najjar syndrome of types I and II is characterized by structural mutations on one of 5 exons of HUHB gene, resulting in the synthesis of defective catalytically inactive isoforms of the enzyme. In Gilbert's syndrome, genetic alterations are located at the promoter of the gene and accompanied by the nucleotide insert of thymine adenine (TA). Promoter prolongation impairs the binding of IID transcription factor and leads to the decreased production of the enzyme UDPGT 1,1. Examination of the molecular epidemiology of gene mutations of UDPGT 1,1 that is typical of Gilbert's syndrome ascertained a great difference in the indices, from 2 to 16% in the Asian and European populations, respectively. In addition to polymerase chain reaction, high performance liquid chromatography may be used for the diagnosis of genetic alterations in Gilbert's syndrome.

J Lab Clin Med. 1981 Jul;98(1):37-45. Implications for the diagnosis of Gilbert's syndrome. BRT and CBR were determined from studies of radiobilirubin kinetics in 14 patients undergoing splenectomy for hereditary spherocytosis. Studies were conducted both before and after the operation in order to assess the effects of the postsplenectomy fall in BRT on CBR. Splenectomy led to a doubling of the RBC-t1/2 from 13.0 +/- 1.7 (S.E.) days to 26.1 +/- 1.5 and a fall in BRT from 15.9 +/- 4.4 mg/kg/day to 4.3 +/- 0.9. In seven patients (group A) initially normal values for CBR were unaltered by surgery. In the remaining seven (group B), low preoperative values for CBR, suggestive of Gilbert's syndrome, uniformly improved after splenectomy, becoming normal in five patients. Nevertheless, family studies and reduced values for UDPGT activity supported the initial impression of concomitant Gilbert's syndrome in group B. These studies suggest the existence of a latent state for Gilbert's syndrome that, in some patients, may be unmasked by a hemolytic stress. As such, they have important implications for both pedigree analysis and incidence studies of this condition.
Gilbert_syndrome	UDPGT	Positive	PMID:383356	Macklon AF, Savage RL, Rawlins MD: Gilbert's syndrome and drug metabolism. Clin Pharmacokinet. 1979 May-Jun;4(3):223-32. Gilbert's syndrome is an inherited disorder which is characterised by unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia. In patients with Gilbert's syndrome, both bilirubin clearance and in vitro hepatic microsomal uridine diphosphoglucuronyl transferase (UDPGT) activity are reduced. In addition, there is evidence suggesting impaired hepatic uptake of bilirubin in Gilbert's syndrome. Glucuronidation of a number of substrates appears to be impaired in Gilbert's syndrome, but the significance of the reported changes in oxidation and acetylation are less clear.

Eur J Haematol. 1999 May;62(5):307-10. In this study we analyzed the effect of the (TA) 7 polymorphism of the UGT1A gene associated with Gilbert's syndrome in G6PD-deficient subjects during an acute hemolytic crisis (fabic crisis). DNA from 44 subjects originating from the same geographic area in Sardinia was analyzed for the UGT1A promoter polymorphism. The increase of unconjugated bilirubin level during fabic crisis and its relationship with UGT1A polymorphism was evaluated. The UGT1A (TA) 7 TATA box variant was found in 9/44 (21%) of the G6PD deficient subjects examined. The median value for unit of increase of bilirubin (mg/dl)/unit of decrease of hemoglobin (g/dl) was higher in variant homozygous than in heterozygous and normal subjects. These findings imply a contribution of the UGT1A polymorphism associated to Gilbert's syndrome to development of the hyperbilirubinemia in G6PD deficient subjects during acute hemolytic anemia.
Gilbert_syndrome	CDA-II	Negative	PMID:10753261	Perrotta S, del Giudice EM, Carbone R, Servedio V, Schettini F Jr, Nobili B, Iolascon A: Gilbert's syndrome accounts for the phenotypic variability of congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type II (CDA-II). J Pediatr. 2000 Apr;136(4):556-9. The molecular basis for the considerable variation of serum bilirubin levels and the incidence of gallstone formation in patients with congenital dyserythropoietic anemia (CDA) type II are unknown. We show that the combined effect of an increased bilirubin load caused by dyserythropoiesis in CDA II and decreased bilirubin conjugation caused by reduced expression of uridine diphosphate glucuronosyl transferase (UGT1A) would increase the risk of hyperbilirubinemia (P gallstone formation (chi (2): P gallstone formation in patients with CDA II is 4. 75-fold the rate of patients without Gilbert's syndrome, and gallstone diagnosis occurs at a younger age (P CDA II.

Dermatol Surg. 2003 Jul;29(7):759-65. BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis (NF) is a genetic disorder of the neural sheet, affecting almost all organ systems. METHOD: A family that consisted of the father and his three children, two males and one female, having NF-1 is evaluated in detail for cosmetic purposes. The routine preoperative laboratory examinations, including complete blood counts, serum biochemistries, urinary analysis, extremity and chest roentgenograms, ultrasounds of the abdomen and the affected regions, and pelvic computed tomographies, revealed characteristics of NF-1 and unexpected hyperbilirubinemia. The patients are evaluated further for the cause of hyperbilirubinemia by the fasting test. Variously localized plexiform neurofibromas of the three children are totally excised. RESULTS: The father was affected as a result of a mutation, and his three children had inherited the disease. The father, having subcutaneous neurofibromas, differs from the children, as they have elephantiasis neurofibromatosa. The children had various rare clinical presentations besides disfiguring deformities. Two male patients had retroperitoneal neurofibromas, and one had splenomegaly and osseous changes. Gilbert's disease was diagnosed, interestingly, and coincidentally in the three patients with elephantiasis due to NF-1. DISCUSSION: An interesting diagnosis of NF occurring coincidentally with Gilbert's disease in a family is reported. This clinical study is the first report of Gilbert's disease accompanying familial NF.

Biopharm Drug Dispos. 1993 Oct;14(7):567-78. The glutathione (GSH) S-transferases are believed to have dual functions as hepatic detoxifying enzymes and intrahepatic binding proteins. Little is known about their alterations in human liver diseases. Therefore, we have studied the relationship between the enzyme activity and rose bengal (RB) binding in hepatic cytosol and plasma indocyanine green (ICG) kinetics in patients with various liver diseases. The enzyme activity was measured in samples of hepatic cytosol obtained from 52 patients. In addition, the content of cationic and neutral transferases was estimated in 17 biopsy samples by densitometry of Coomassie blue stained sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoretograms. RB binding studies also were performed on cytosol samples. ICG kinetic parameters were determined using the two-compartment open model in 17 patients who were given the dye (0.5 mg kg-1) intravenously. Correlations between the enzyme activity and liver function tests, content of the enzyme, RB binding and ICG kinetic parameters were evaluated. The following results were obtained. (1) The enzyme activities were high in alcoholic liver disease, fatty liver and Gilbert's syndrome, and low in cirrhosis. (2) The enzyme activities were positively correlated with serum cholinesterase activity, serum albumin level and hepaplastin test, and negatively correlated with ICG retention rate at 15 min. (3) The enzyme activity, its content and RB binding affinity of the cytosol were positively correlated with each other. (4) The enzyme activity was positively correlated with hepatic ICG distribution volume. These results are consistent with the role of the GSH S-transferases as ligandins in intracellular storage of dyes.

Polymorphisms have been detected in a variety of xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes at both the phenotypic and genotypic level. In the case of four enzymes, the cytochrome P450 CYP2D6, glutathione S-transferase mu, N-acetyltransferase 2 and serum cholinesterase, the majority of mutations which give rise to a defective phenotype have now been identified. Another group of enzymes show definite polymorphism at the phenotypic level but the exact genetic mechanisms responsible are not yet clear. These enzymes include the cytochromes P450 CYP1A1, CYP1A2 and a CYP2C form which metabolizes mephenytoin, a flavin-linked monooxygenase (fish-odour syndrome), paraoxonase, UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (Gilbert's syndrome) and thiopurine S-methyltransferase. In the case of a further group of enzymes, there is some evidence for polymorphism at either the phenotypic or genotypic level but this has not been unambiguously demonstrated. Examples of this class include the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2A6, CYP2E1, CYP2C9 and CYP3A4, xanthine oxidase, an S-oxidase which metabolizes carbocysteine, epoxide hydrolase, two forms of sulphotransferase and several methyltransferases. The nature of all these polymorphisms and possible polymorphisms is discussed in detail, with particular reference to the effects of this variation on drug metabolism and susceptibility to chemically-induced diseases.

Gastroenterology. 1995 Jun;108(6):1802-9. BACKGROUND/AIMS: Bile duct epithelia contain an abundance of carbonic anhydrase. Antibodies to this enzyme have been described in autoimmune disorders. Serum from patients with immune-mediated liver diseases was studied to determine whether antibodies to carbonic anhydrase II and/or pyruvate dehydrogenase could distinguish autoimmune cholangitis as immunologically distinct from primary biliary cirrhosis. METHODS: Antibody assays to carbonic anhydrase II (Western blot) and pyruvate dehydrogenase (flow cytometry) were performed on the sera of patients with autoimmune cholangitis (6), primary biliary cirrhosis (12), primary sclerosing cholangitis (12), autoimmune hepatitis (12), and control (Gilbert syndrome; 8). RESULTS: Reactivity to carbonic anhydrase II was detected in 5 of 6 patients with autoimmune cholangitis, 1 of 12 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, 1 of 12 patients with autoimmune hepatitis, and no other patients. Individuals with autoimmune cholangitis were more likely than the other patients to be reactive to carbonic anhydrase II (P primary biliary cirrhosis were more reactive to pyruvate dehydrogenase compared with all other groups (P antibody to human carbonic anhydrase II is frequently detected in the sera of patients with autoimmune cholangitis and is uncommon or not present in other cholangiopathies. These data provide evidence that autoimmune cholangitis and primary biliary cirrhosis represent distinct entities with unique patterns of immunoreactivity.
Gilbert_syndrome	CN-II	Negative	PMID:9630669	Yamamoto K, Sato H, Fujiyama Y, Doida Y, Bamba T: Contribution of two missense mutations (G71R and Y486D) of the bilirubin UDP glycosyltransferase (UGT1A1) gene to phenotypes of Gilbert's syndrome and Crigler-Najjar syndrome type II. Biochim Biophys Acta. 1998 Apr 28;1406(3):267-73. In our mutation analyses of bilirubin UDP glycosyltransferase (UGT1A1) gene, we encountered six patients with Crigler-Najjar syndrome type II who were double homozygotes for G71R and Y486D, a patient with Gilbert's syndrome who was a single homozygote for G71R and six patients with Gilbert's syndrome who were single heterozygote for G71R. To clarify the role of each mutation in the occurrence of the two syndromes, we made four mutant expression models. Relative UGT1A1 activity of a single homozygous model of G71R was 32.2+/-1.6% of normal, that of a single homozygous model of Y486D was 7.6+/-0.5%, that of a double homozygous model of G71R and Y486D was 6.2+/-1.6% and that of a heterozygous model of G71R was 60.2+/-3.5%. The decreased activities of the single homozygous model of G71R and the double homozygous model were at an appropriate level to be diagnosed as Gilbert's syndrome and CN-II, respectively. The activity of a single heterozygous model of G71R was somewhat high to develop to the phenotype of Gilbert's syndrome, suggesting the presence of additional factors for the etiology of Gilbert's syndrome.

Polymorphisms have been detected in a variety of xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes at both the phenotypic and genotypic level. In the case of four enzymes, the cytochrome P450 CYP2D6, glutathione S-transferase mu, N-acetyltransferase 2 and serum cholinesterase, the majority of mutations which give rise to a defective phenotype have now been identified. Another group of enzymes show definite polymorphism at the phenotypic level but the exact genetic mechanisms responsible are not yet clear. These enzymes include the cytochromes P450 CYP1A1, CYP1A2 and a CYP2C form which metabolizes mephenytoin, a flavin-linked monooxygenase (fish-odour syndrome), paraoxonase, UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (Gilbert's syndrome) and thiopurine S-methyltransferase. In the case of a further group of enzymes, there is some evidence for polymorphism at either the phenotypic or genotypic level but this has not been unambiguously demonstrated. Examples of this class include the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2A6, CYP2E1, CYP2C9 and CYP3A4, xanthine oxidase, an S-oxidase which metabolizes carbocysteine, epoxide hydrolase, two forms of sulphotransferase and several methyltransferases. The nature of all these polymorphisms and possible polymorphisms is discussed in detail, with particular reference to the effects of this variation on drug metabolism and susceptibility to chemically-induced diseases.
Gilbert_syndrome	carbonic-anhydrase-II	Negative	PMID:7768386	Gordon SC, Quattrociocchi-Longe TM, Khan BA, Kodali VP, Chen J, Silverman AL, Kiechle FL: Antibodies to carbonic anhydrase in patients with immune cholangiopathies. Gastroenterology. 1995 Jun;108(6):1802-9. BACKGROUND/AIMS: Bile duct epithelia contain an abundance of carbonic anhydrase. Antibodies to this enzyme have been described in autoimmune disorders. Serum from patients with immune-mediated liver diseases was studied to determine whether antibodies to carbonic anhydrase II and/or pyruvate dehydrogenase could distinguish autoimmune cholangitis as immunologically distinct from primary biliary cirrhosis. METHODS: Antibody assays to carbonic anhydrase II (Western blot) and pyruvate dehydrogenase (flow cytometry) were performed on the sera of patients with autoimmune cholangitis (6), primary biliary cirrhosis (12), primary sclerosing cholangitis (12), autoimmune hepatitis (12), and control (Gilbert syndrome; 8). RESULTS: Reactivity to carbonic anhydrase II was detected in 5 of 6 patients with autoimmune cholangitis, 1 of 12 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, 1 of 12 patients with autoimmune hepatitis, and no other patients. Individuals with autoimmune cholangitis were more likely than the other patients to be reactive to carbonic anhydrase II (P primary biliary cirrhosis were more reactive to pyruvate dehydrogenase compared with all other groups (P antibody to human carbonic anhydrase II is frequently detected in the sera of patients with autoimmune cholangitis and is uncommon or not present in other cholangiopathies. These data provide evidence that autoimmune cholangitis and primary biliary cirrhosis represent distinct entities with unique patterns of immunoreactivity.

Pediatr Res. 2007 Apr 5;. Increased heme catabolism has been reported in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD)-normal neonates who were also homozygous for (TA) 7/(TA) 7 (UGT1A1*28) uridine diphosphoglucuronate-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT) promoter polymorphism (Gilbert syndrome). As G-6-PD deficiency is associated with increased hemolysis, we hypothesized that in G-6-PD-deficient neonates who also have the (TA) 7/(TA) 7 UGT promoter genotype, steady-state hemolysis would be even further increased. Male G-6-PD-deficient neonates were sampled for plasma total bilirubin (PTB), blood carboxyhemoglobin corrected for inhaled carbon monoxide in ambient air (COHbc) (an index of heme catabolism), and UGT (TA) n promoter genotype determination and compared with previously published G-6-PD-normal neonates. Although COHbc values were higher in the G-6-PD-deficient than in the G-6-PD-normal cohorts (0.97 +/- 0.32% of total Hb (tHb) versus 0.76 +/- 0.19% of tHb, p PTB values were similar (9.2 +/- 3.4 mg/dL versus 8.9 +/- 3.0 mg/dL, respectively, p = 0.3). Within the G-6-PD-deficient group, although COHbc values were alike between the three UGT promoter genotypes, PTB was higher in the (TA) 7/(TA) 7 homozygotes (11.1 +/- 4.0 mg/dL) compared with (TA) 6/(TA) 7 heterozygotes (9.1 +/- 3.2 mg/dL, p = 0.03) and wild-type (TA) 6/(TA) 6 homozygotes (8.8 +/- 3.4 mg/dL, p = 0.02). In the steady state, similar rates of hemolysis, but increased PTB in the G-6-PD-deficient, (TA) 7/(TA) 7 homozygotes, imply that (TA) 7/(TA) 7 homozygosity is central to increased PTB.

Blood Cells Mol Dis. 2002 Mar-Apr;28(2):104-7. A patient with chronic hemolytic anemia and G6PD deficiency was noted to be severely jaundiced and to have a high serum ferritin level. Analysis of his DNA revealed only heterozygosity for the c.187 C--> G (H63D) mutation of HFE, but showed that he was homozygous for the UDP glucuronosyltransferase promoter mutation of Gilbert's disease and that he had a previously undescribed mutation of G6PD, c.832 T--> C (Ser278Pro). The new variant was named G6PD La Jolla.

Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2002 Jan-Feb;19(1):39-44. The case of an 8-year-old male child with severe kernicterus sequelae is presented in this paper. The child's hemoglobin value varied between 6.0 and 10.8 g/dL and his reticulocyte count ranged between 3.4 and 46.0% during the steady-state condition and hyperhemolytic crisis, respectively. A chronic hemolytic type of red cell G6PD deficiency was diagnosed. DNA studies indicate that the mutation was G6PD Guadalajara 1159 C --> T (387 Arg --> Cys) that is situated at the NADP binding site. Additionally, extra nucleotides of (TA) in the A (TA) n TAA motif of the promoter region of the uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase gene (UGT-1 A) were found to be homozygous in the patient. The coexistence of Gilbert syndrome with a chronic type of G6PD deficiency was suggested as a cause of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia leading to kernicterus.

Pediatr Res. 2001 Oct;50(4):532-7. The objective was to compare the contribution to perinatal bilirubinemia of hemolysis and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) gene promoter polymorphism, seen in Gilbert's syndrome, between glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD)-deficient and -normal neonates. Serum total bilirubin (STB) values from 52 G-6-PD-deficient and 166 G-6-PD-normal term, male neonates, sampled within 3 h of delivery (first sample) and on d 3 (second sample), were analyzed in relation to blood carboxyhemoglobin corrected for inspired CO (COHbc), an accurate index of hemolysis, and UGT promoter genotype. COHbc values (% total Hb) were greater in G-6-PD-deficient neonates than controls: first sample 1.00 +/- 0.25% versus 0.84 +/- 0.24%, p deficient or control groups, whereas second sample COHbc values correlated significantly with corresponding STB values in the control population only (r = 0.28, p = 0.0007). At second sampling, there was a higher allele frequency of the variant UGT promoter among those with STB values > or =75th percentile than those deficient neonates (0.60 versus 0.33, respectively, p = 0.025), but not controls (0.31 versus 0.40, respectively, p = 0.24). Among those infants with at least one variant UGT promoter allele, STB values were higher in the G-6-PD-deficient neonates than controls at second sampling only (181 +/- 56 microM versus 149 +/- 46 microM, respectively, p = 0.03). Both within and between the G-6-PD-deficient and control groups, our data demonstrate changing and differing contributions of hemolysis and UGT promoter polymorphism to bilirubinemia during the first 3 d of life.

Haematologica. 1999 Feb;84(2):99-102. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The pathogenesis of the hyperbilirubinemia present in approximately 30% of neonates affected by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency is an unsolved problem. We evaluated the effect of Gilbert's syndrome, the most common defect of bilirubin conjugation, on the hyperbilirubinemia of these neonates. DESIGN AND METHODS: One hundred and two neonates affected by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency were enrolled in this study: 56 had hyperbilirubinemia and 46 had normal bilirubin levels. The analysis of the A (TA) nTAA motif in the promoter region of the UGT1A gene was performed by means of PCR, followed by separation on 6% denaturing polycrylamide gel. RESULTS: The frequency of the three different genotypes of the A (TA) nTAA motif was similar in the study and control groups. Our results demonstrated no difference in the percentage of homozygotes for the UGT1A (TA) 7 variant associated with Gilbert's syndrome. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that Gilbert's syndrome does not account for the hyperbilirubinemia occurring in some neonates with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. Furthermore our results suggest that hemolysis is not the major event in the pathogenesis of hyperbilirubinemia in these patients.
Gilbert_syndrome	UDP-glucuronosyl-transferase	Positive	PMID:12895198	Skarke C, Schmidt H, Geisslinger G, Darimont J, Lotsch J: Pharmacokinetics of morphine are not altered in subjects with Gilbert's syndrome. Br J Clin Pharmacol. 2003 Aug;56(2):228-31. AIMS: To verify that Gilbert's syndrome, which is caused by decreased glucuronidation capacity of the UDP-glucuronosyl transferase (UGT) 1A1, does not account for impaired morphine clearance. METHODS: Noncompartmental pharmacokinetic parameters for morphine and its glucuronide metabolites were compared between five carriers of Gilbert's syndrome and six noncarriers after a 7.5 mg (19.8 micro mol) intravenous injection of morphine sulphate pentahydrate. To estimate the amount of morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G) formed from morphine, 1 mg of deuterized M6G was injected intravenously at the same time. RESULTS: No differences were detected between carriers and noncarriers of Gilbert's syndrome in the clearance of morphine (80.1 +/- 12 l h (-1) vs 87.9 +/- 22 l h (-1)) and in the percentage of morphine that was metabolized to M6G (10.9 +/- 1.4 vs 13 +/- 2). The areas under the plasma concentration vs time curves of morphine, M6G and morphine-3-glucuronide also did not differ between carriers and noncarriers of Gilbert's syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Gilbert's syndrome is not a factor to be considered when prescribing morphine.

J Inherit Metab Dis. 1999 Aug;22(6):747-53. The Gly71Arg mutation of the hepatic bilirubin UDP glucuronosyl-transferase (B-UGT) gene associated with Gilbert syndrome prevails among Japanese and its gene frequency is 0.13. Among 20 patients with acute leukaemia, 4 patients showed intermittent unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia during the course of combined chemotherapy. The Gly71Arg mutation was detected in all 4 patients with hyperbilirubinaemia, but was not found in 16 patients without hyperbilirubinaemia. Two of them were heterozygotes and one was a homozygote for the Gly71Arg mutation, and the other was a compound heterozygote of the Gly71Arg mutation and TA insertion mutation in the TATA box of the B-UGT gene. In addition to the complications leading to hyperbilirubinaemia, including liver damage due to drugs, viral infections or tumour cell infiltrations and alloimmune haemolysis, carrier status for the Gly71Arg mutation should be considered in a patient with leukaemia showing intermittent hyperbilirubinaemia during the course of chemotherapy, especially among Japanese, Koreans and Chinese owing to its prevalence in those populations.
Gilbert_syndrome	UDP-glucuronosyl-transferase	Positive	PMID:10412886	Esteban A, Perez-Mateo M: Heterogeneity of paracetamol metabolism in Gilbert's syndrome. Eur J Drug Metab Pharmacokinet. 1999 Jan-Mar;24(1):9-13. Gilbert's syndrome (GS) is an inherited bilirubin UDP-glucuronosyl transferase deficiency. The object of this study was to investigate the possible effects of this disorder on the metabolism of a drug, such as paracetamol, which is basically eliminated by hepatic glucuronidation. We studied 32 healthy volunteers and 18 people with GS, all of whom were given 1.5 g of paracetamol orally. In the 24 h urine collected, we determined the elimination of free paracetamol, the conjugates (glucuronide, sulphate) and the oxidation products (cysteine, mercapturic acid) by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). The results are given as a percentage of the total quantity of paracetamol eliminated. The patients with GS were divided into 2 subgroups (GS-I and GS-II) according to whether glucuronidation was more or less than 50%. The overall results of the GS group showed no significant difference in the urinary elimination of metabolites as compared to the control group. However, in subgroup GS-I, a reduction in glucuronidation (P = 0.0012) and an increase in oxidation (P = 0.0051) was seen, as compared with the other 2 groups. There was inverse correlation between the glucuronide produced by conjugation and the oxidation products (r = -0.8718; P paracetamol. In one subgroup this was normal. In the other subgroup there was a marked reduction in glucuronidation and an increase in oxidation. These changes could mean that people in this subgroup are more liable to liver damage after an overdose of paracetamol.

Polymorphisms have been detected in a variety of xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes at both the phenotypic and genotypic level. In the case of four enzymes, the cytochrome P450 CYP2D6, glutathione S-transferase mu, N-acetyltransferase 2 and serum cholinesterase, the majority of mutations which give rise to a defective phenotype have now been identified. Another group of enzymes show definite polymorphism at the phenotypic level but the exact genetic mechanisms responsible are not yet clear. These enzymes include the cytochromes P450 CYP1A1, CYP1A2 and a CYP2C form which metabolizes mephenytoin, a flavin-linked monooxygenase (fish-odour syndrome), paraoxonase, UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (Gilbert's syndrome) and thiopurine S-methyltransferase. In the case of a further group of enzymes, there is some evidence for polymorphism at either the phenotypic or genotypic level but this has not been unambiguously demonstrated. Examples of this class include the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2A6, CYP2E1, CYP2C9 and CYP3A4, xanthine oxidase, an S-oxidase which metabolizes carbocysteine, epoxide hydrolase, two forms of sulphotransferase and several methyltransferases. The nature of all these polymorphisms and possible polymorphisms is discussed in detail, with particular reference to the effects of this variation on drug metabolism and susceptibility to chemically-induced diseases.

Pharmacogenomics J. 2006 May-Jun;6(3):211-9. Retigabine (RGB) is an investigational antiepileptic drug, which undergoes extensive UGT1A1, 1A9 and 1A4-mediated N-glucuronidation and N-acetylation. The mono-acetylated metabolite of RGB has some pharmacological activity and is denoted AWD21-360. We investigated whether the pharmacokinetics (PK) of RGB and AWD21-360 are altered in subjects with Gilbert's syndrome (GS) and/or with frequent N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) slow acetylator (SA) polymorphisms. Based on consistent genotyping and phenotyping screening results, 37 Caucasian subjects (21-46 years; 31 men, six women) were assigned to one of the following groups: (1) absence of GS (non-GS)/rapid acetylator (RA) (N=11); (2) GS/RA (N=8); (3) non-GS/SA (N=11); (4) GS/SA (N=7). Subjects received single and multiple (b.i.d.) 200-mg oral RGB doses over 5 days. Blood samples were collected up to 60 h after dosing for plasma PK of RGB and AWD21-360. Group comparisons were performed by ANOVA. Single-dose PK of RGB and AWD21-360 and multiple-dose PK of RGB did not differ significantly between groups. After multiple dose treatment, RA subjects showed a significantly higher total exposure to AWD21-360 of about 32% (95% CI 101.9-172.5) relative to SA subjects (P=0.0362). The UGT1A1 metabolic capacity (i.e. presence or absence of GS), however, did not significantly affect the overall exposure to AWD21-360. The results indicate that the PK of RGB is unaltered in individuals with GS, in subjects with NAT2 SA status, and in carriers of both variants, whereas the total exposure to AWD21-360 is significantly related to the RA or SA status of subjects. Results further suggest that metabolic switching to the mono-acetylated metabolite AWD21-360 may partially compensate for the impaired glucuronidation capacity in GS subjects. RGB treatment showed no significant differences in tolerability and safety between groups.

Eur J Gastroenterol Hepatol. 2007 Apr;19(4):337-40. Gilbert's syndrome is a common inherited disorder, in which genetic defects in uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 lead to deficient glucuronidation of bilirubin and hence hyperbilirubinaemia. Although usually considered asymptomatic, Gilbert's syndrome can be associated with gastrointestinal and psychiatric symptoms unexplained by the metabolic defect. Genetic polymorphism of a closely related enzyme, uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase 1A6, results in altered metabolism and elimination of serotonin. On the basis of a case of hyperserotoninaemia in the absence of a detectable carcinoid tumour in a patient with Gilbert's syndrome, who presented with a history of night sweats, flushing, abdominal discomfort and intermittent diarrhoea, we propose that in a subgroup of Gilbert's syndrome patients, homozygocity for dual uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 and uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase 1A6 polymorphisms may lead to combined hyperbilirubinaemia and hyperserotoninaemia. The latter may account for symptoms experienced by patients with Gilbert's syndrome hitherto considered unrelated to, or unexplainable by, the known defect in bilirubin metabolism.
Gilbert_syndrome	UDP-glucuronosyltransferases	Negative	PMID:12480553	Peters WH, te Morsche RH, Roelofs HM: Combined polymorphisms in UDP-glucuronosyltransferases 1A1 and 1A6: implications for patients with Gilbert's syndrome. J Hepatol. 2003 Jan;38(1):3-8. BACKGROUND/AIMS: UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) are important enzymes involved in glucuronidation of various exogenous and endogenous compounds. Studies were undertaken on the variability of three UGT enzyme activities in human livers. Enzyme activities were associated with genetic polymorphisms in UGT1A1 (UGT1A1*28) and UGT1A6 (UGT1A6*2). UGT1A1*28 is associated with Gilbert's syndrome, a deficiency in glucuronidation of bilirubin leading to mild hyperbilirubinemia, whereas UGT1A6*2 may result in low glucuronidation rates of several drugs. METHODS: Enzyme activities and genetic polymorphisms were assessed in 39 human liver samples, and polymorphisms were also assessed in blood of 253 healthy controls. RESULTS: Associations were found between UGT enzyme activities of bilirubin (B) and 4-nitrophenol (NP; r=0.47, P=0.0024), B and 4-methylumbelliferone (MUB; r=0.54, P=0.0003), and NP and MUB (r=0.89, P association between B-UGT enzyme activity and UGT1A1*28 (r=0.45, P=0.0034) as reported earlier, an association between B-UGT and UGT1A6*2 (r=0.43, P=0.007) was found. In 253 Dutch Caucasian controls, co-occurrence of UGT1A1*28 and UGT1A6*2 was found (r=0.9, P Gilbert's syndrome, in addition to their reduced B-UGT enzyme activity, may have abnormalities in the glucuronidation of aspirin or coumarin- and dopamine-derivatives, due to this combination of UGT1A1*28 and UGT1A6*2 genotypes.
Gilbert_syndrome	UGT1A1	Positive	PMID:17496722	Hsieh TY, Shiu TY, Huang SM, Lin HH, Lee TC, Chen PJ, Chu HC, Chang WK, Jeng KS, Lai MM, Chao YC: Molecular pathogenesis of Gilbert's syndrome: decreased TATA-binding protein binding affinity of UGT1A1 gene promoter. Pharmacogenet Genomics. 2007 Apr;17(4):229-36. OBJECTIVES: Gilbert's syndrome is a congenital, nonhemolytic, unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. The most common genotype of Gilbert's syndrome is the homozygous polymorphism, A (TA) 7TAA, in the promoter of the gene for UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1), with a thymine adenine insertion in the TATA-box-like sequence, which results in a decrease in UGT1A1 activity. The mechanism responsible for this decrease in UGT1A1 activity, however, has not been elucidated. To clarify the mechanism underlying this deficiency in UGT1A1 activity in patients with Gilbert's syndrome. METHODS: The promoter activity assay using the wild-type A (TA) 6TAA or the mutant A (TA) 7TAA promoter and a luciferase reporter was performed in two different hepatoma cell lines. The binding affinity for a nuclear protein complex or for TATA-binding protein was evaluated by a competitive electophoretic mobility shift assay using wild-type or mutant TATA-box-like oligonucleotide probes and nuclear extract or TATA-binding protein. The formation of complexes between TATA-binding protein and wild-type or mutant oligonucleotide probes was also studied by a quantitive electophoretic mobility shift assay. RESULTS: A TA insertion in the TATA-box-like sequence of the promoter activity of UGT1A1 gene. A competitive electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed a decrease in nuclear protein complex binding affinity and TATA-binding protein binding affinity of the mutant TATA-box-like sequence A (TA) 7TAA. When the mutants A (TA) 5TAA and A (TA) 8TAA were also compared, quantitative electrophoretic mobility shift assay demonstrated that the TATA-binding protein binding affinity progressively decreased as the number of TA repeats in the TATA-box-like sequence increased. CONCLUSION: TA insertion in the TATA-box-like sequence of the UGT1A1 promoter affected its binding affinity for TATA-binding protein, causing a decrease in its activity. This explains the pathogenesis of Gilbert's syndrome.

Dig Liver Dis. 2007 Apr;39(4):351-5. Epub 2007 Mar 7. BACKGROUND AND AIM: To clarify the precise mode of inheritance of Gilbert syndrome, an unconjugated familial hyperbilirubinemia, where impaired bilirubin conjugation is caused by reduced UGT1A1 activity determined by a defective function of the A (TA) 6TAA promoter region of the UGT1A1 gene. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Serum bilirubin levels were measured in a large, homogeneous resident population from North-Eastern Italy, consisting of 1.639 males (age 44.5+/-13.9, range 18-89 years), and 1.420 females (age 45.1+/-15.0, range 18-85). In 112 nuclear families from hyperbilirubinemic probands living in the same area a complex segregation analysis was then performed. In both samples we carefully excluded potentially confounding factors of bilirubin levels (alcohol abuse, excessive cigarette smoking, drug consumption, overt haemolysis and liver disease). RESULTS: Mean serum bilirubin concentrations are higher in males than in females, showing fluctuations through the different age periods in males. Complex segregation results demonstrate that unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia exhibits a precise mode of inheritance in which a major recessive gene with a frequency of 0.45 is responsible for higher serum bilirubin values. CONCLUSIONS: This major recessive gene accounts only for a part of the serum bilirubin concentration, thus implying additional, environmental factors for the clinical appearance of GS.
Gilbert_syndrome	UGT1A1	Positive	PMID:16969497	Urawa N, Kobayashi Y, Araki J, Sugimoto R, Iwasa M, Kaito M, Adachi Y: Linkage disequilibrium of UGT1A1 *6 and UGT1A1 *28 in relation to UGT1A6 and UGT1A7 polymorphisms. Oncol Rep. 2006 Oct;16(4):801-6. UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes are responsible for the glucuronidation and detoxification of many endogenous or exogenous xenobiotics. Gilbert's syndrome (GS) and Crigler Najjar syndrome type 2 (CNS-II) are characterized by unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia due to reduced enzymatic activity of UGT1A1. Recent studies have demonstrated the frequent co-existence of UGT1A1 *28 (-53 [TA] 6> 7) with other polymorphisms of UGT1A6 and UGT1A7. This finding suggests the occurrence of linkage disequilibrium (LD) among UGT1A1, UGT1A6 and UGT1A7 polymorphisms. UGT1A1 *6 (211G> A, G71R) and UGT1A1 *28 are common in Asian populations. In the present study, we investigated the LD of UGT1A1 *6 and UGT1A1 *28 in relation to UGT1A6 and UGT1A7 polymorphisms. Exon 1 of UGT1A1, UGT1A6 and UGT1A7 was sequenced using genomic DNA isolated from peripheral leukocytes of 390 Japanese subjects. LD and haplotypes were analyzed using SNPAlyze ver. 5.0 software. UGT1A1 *6 had a strong LD in relation to UGT1A6 variants including 541A> G and 552A> C (D'=0.846-0.848, r (2)=0.413-0.438) and UGT1A7 variants including 387T> G, 391C> A, 392G> A and 622T> C (D'=0.667-0.858, r (2)=0.207-0.413). UGT1A1 *28 had a lower degree of LD than UGT1A1 *6 in relation to these variants (D'=0.245-0.401, r (2)=0.025-0.063). All the haplotypes with G71R lacked -53 [TA] 6> 7. The present study showed for the first time that the LD of UGT1A1 *6 in relation to UGT1A6 and 1A7 polymorphisms is far stronger than UGT1A1 *28. The UGT1A1 *6 allele appears to be independent of the UGT1A1 *28 allele. Although patients with GS and CNS-II are believed to have good prognosis, a subgroup of GS or CNS-II patients with the UGT1A1 *6 polymorphism might be at risk of abnormal drug metabolism and of developing malignant disease.
Gilbert_syndrome	UGT1A1	Positive	PMID:16792515	Ferraris A, D'Amato G, Nobili V, Torres B, Marcellini M, Dallapiccola B: Combined test for UGT1A1 -3279T--> G and A (TA) nTAA polymorphisms best predicts Gilbert's syndrome in Italian pediatric patients. Genet Test. 2006 Summer;10(2):121-5. Gilbert's syndrome is a common hereditary chronic or recurrent, mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Polymorphisms in the bilirubin uridine diphosphate glucuronosyl transferase gene (UGT1A1) causing a decreased enzyme activity are associated with susceptibility to the syndrome. Homozygosity for TA (7) allele of the A (TA)(n) TAA promoter polymorphism is found in the majority of Caucasian patients. We sought to investigate the role of three UGT1A1 polymorphisms (A [TA](n) TAA, -3279T--> G, and G71R) in the susceptibility to Gilbert's syndrome in 53 Italian pediatric subjects compared to 83 unaffected controls. Carriage of two TA (n) risk alleles (TA (7) and TA (8)) and -3279G homozygosity were similarly associated with hyperbilirubinemia (odds ratio [OR] = 11.59, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 4.80-27.98; p associated with the highest relative risk estimate (OR = 19.23, 95% CI = 7.34-50.4; p association was found also for TA7 heterozygosity combined with -3279G/G genotype (OR = 7.98, 95% CI = 2.54-25.06; p UGT1A1 A (TA)(n) TAA and -3279T--> G polymorphisms best defines genetic susceptibility to Gilbert's syndrome in Caucasian pediatric patients, and the TA7 heterozygous genotype combined with homozygosity for the -3279G allele can also be associated with pediatric mild hyperbilirubinemia.
Gilbert_syndrome	UGT1A1	Positive	PMID:16610035	Farheen S, Sengupta S, Santra A, Pal S, Dhali GK, Chakravorty M, Majumder PP, Chowdhury A: Gilbert's syndrome: High frequency of the (TA) 7 TAA allele in India and its interaction with a novel CAT insertion in promoter of the gene for bilirubin UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1 gene. World J Gastroenterol. 2006 Apr 14;12(14):2269-75. AIM: To identify the variants in UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1 (UGT1A1) gene in Gilbert's syndrome (GS) and to estimate the association between homozygosity for TA insertion and GS in India, as well as the frequency of TA insertion and its impact among normal controls in India. METHODS: Ninety-five GS cases and 95 normal controls were selected. Liver function and other tests were done. The promoter and all 5 exons of UGT1A1 gene were resequenced. Functional assessment of a novel trinucleotide insertion was done by in silico analysis and by estimating UGT1A1 promoter activity carried out by luciferase reporter assay of appropriate constructs in Hep G2 cell line. RESULTS: Among the GS patients, 80% were homozygous for the TA insertion, which was several-fold higher than reports from other ethnic groups. The mean UCB level was elevated among individuals with only one copy of this insertion, which was not significantly different from those with two copies. Many new DNA variants in UGT1A1 gene were discovered, including a trinucleotide (CAT) insertion in the promoter found in a subset (10%) of GS patients, but not among normal controls. In-silico analysis showed marked changes in the DNA-folding of the promoter and functional analysis showed a 20-fold reduction in transcription efficiency of UGT1A1 gene resulting from this insertion, thereby significantly elevating the UCB level. CONCLUSION: The genetic epidemiology of GS is variable across ethnic groups and the epistatic interactions among UGT1A1 promoter variants modulate bilirubin glucuronidation.
Gilbert_syndrome	UGT1A1	Positive	PMID:16557566	Wasmuth HE, Keppeler H, Herrmann U, Schirin-Sokhan R, Barker M, Lammert F: Coinheritance of Gilbert syndrome-associated UGT1A1 mutation increases gallstone risk in cystic fibrosis. Hepatology. 2006 Apr;43(4):738-41. The prevalence of "black" pigment gallstones is increased in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Bile acid malabsorption with augmented bilirubin uptake from the intestine and the development of "hyperbilirubinbilia" have been proposed as key factors in gallstone formation in CF patients. We have now tested the hypothesis that the coinheritance of the common UGT1A1 promoter mutation associated with Gilbert syndrome is an additional lithogenic risk factor for gallstone formation in CF. Our results show that patients with CF and gallstones are significantly more likely to carry at least one Gilbert UGT1A1 allele compared with stone-free patients (OR 7.3; P = .042) and that these carriers display significantly higher serum levels of unconjugated bilirubin (P = .002). In conclusion, the Gilbert UGT1A1 allele increases the risk of gallstone formation in CF. This genetic association supports the current concept for gallstone formation in CF and suggests that genetic and exogenous sources contributing to hyperbilirubinbilia might be lithogenic in CF patients.
Gilbert_syndrome	UGT1A1	Positive	PMID:16469709	Yu LH, Gao J, Wang CL, Wang J, Gao Y, Yuan QL, Sun ZX, Wang HY, Zhang CG: [Genetic analysis of the UGT1A1 gene mutation sites in a Chinese family suffered from Gilbert's syndrome]. Yi Chuan. 2006 Jan;28(1):11-6. To learn the variation in the gene for UGT1A1 enzyme, the genetic mechanism in a Chinese Han nationality family suffered from Gilbert's syndrome was studied. At first, genomic DNA from peripheral blood of the sufferer in this family was used for amplifying all of the five exons of the UGT1A1 gene by PCR, and then direct sequencing of the PCR product was applied to analyze gene mutation. The results showed that there existed a G--> A homozygous transition at nucleotide 211 leading the substitution of arginine for glycine at position 71 of corresponding protein product (G71R) and a T--> G homozygous transition at nucleotide 1456 leading the substitution of aspartic acid for tyrosine at position 486 of corresponding protein product (Y486D). No mutation was detected in promoter region and the splicing junction sites. The relevant mutation sites of the other family members were sequenced and identified to be heterozygous in the two above-mentioned mutation sites and in the TA repeat mutation in the promoter region. Furthermore, fresh blood samples were collected from all of the members to detect the serum bilirubin levels to determine the sufferer. The result was consistent with the mutation analysis. It could thus be inferred that this family was caused by mutation in the open reading frame of the gene UGT1A1.
Gilbert_syndrome	UGT1A1	Positive	PMID:16210851	Yusoff S, Van Rostenberghe H, Yusoff NM, Talib NA, Ramli N, Ismail NZ, Ismail WP, Matsuo M, Nishio H: Frequencies of A (TA) 7TAA, G71R, and G493R mutations of the UGT1A1 gene in the Malaysian population. Biol Neonate. 2006;89(3):171-6. Epub 2005 Oct 6. BACKGROUND: Gilbert syndrome is caused by defects in the uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) gene. These mutations differ among different populations and many of them have been found to be genetic risk factors for the development of neonatal jaundice. OBJECTIVES: The objective was to determine the frequencies of the following mutations in the UGT1A1 gene: A (TA) 7TAA (the most common cause of Gilbert syndrome in Caucasians), G71R (more common in the Japanese and Taiwanese population), and G493R (described in a homozygous Malay woman with Crigler-Najjar syndrome type 2) in a group of Malaysian babies with hyperbilirubinemia and a group of normal controls. METHODS: The GeneScan fragment analysis was used to detect the A (TA) 7TAA variant. Mutation screening of both G71R and G493R was performed using denaturing high performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: Fourteen out of fifty-five neonates with hyperbilirubinemia (25%) carried the A (TA) 7TAA mutation (10 heterozygous, 4 homozygous). Seven out of fifty controls (14%) carried this mutation (6 heterozygous, 1 homozygous). The allelic frequencies for hyperbilirubinemia and control patients were 16 and 8%, respectively (p=0.20). Heterozygosity for the G71R mutation was almost equal among both groups (5.5% for hyperbilirubinemia patients and 6.0% for controls; p=0.61). One subject (1.8%) in the hyperbilirubinemia group and none of the controls were heterozygous for the G493R mutation (p=0.476). CONCLUSIONS: The A (TA) 7TAA seems more common than the G71R and G493R mutations in the Malaysian population.

Gastroenterology. 2005 Jul;129(1):315-20. BACKGROUND & AIMS: Dubin-Johnson syndrome is recessively inherited, conjugated hyperbilirubinemia induced by mutations in the ABCC2/MRP2 gene encoding the canalicular transporter for conjugated bilirubin. Gilbert's syndrome is recessively inherited, unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia caused by decreased conjugation rate of bilirubin associated mostly with homozygous A (TA) 7 TAA variant of the TATAA-box in the UGT1A1 gene promoter. Our aim was to establish the molecular diagnosis in a 3-year-old male with atypical, intermittent, predominantly unconjugated, hyperbilirubinemia. METHODS: 99m Tc-HIDA cholescintigraphy was used for imaging the biliary tree. Expression of ABCC2/MRP2 protein in hepatocytes was investigated immunohistochemically. UGT1A1 and ABCC2/MRP2 genes were sequenced from genomic DNA, and the mutations were verified by fragment analysis, sequencing the cloned exons, and restriction fragment length polymorphism. RESULTS: Cholescintigraphy revealed delayed visualization of the gallbladder. A brown granular lipopigment differing from melanin-like pigment reported in Dubin-Johnson syndrome was present in hepatocytes, but, otherwise, liver histology was normal. ABCC2/MRP2 protein was not detected on the canalicular membrane of hepatocytes, and 2 novel mutations were found in the ABCC2/MRP2 gene: a heterozygous in-frame insertion-deletion mutation 1256insCT/delAAACAGTGAACCTGATG in exon 10 inherited from the father and a heterozygous deletion 4292delCA in exon 30 inherited from the mother. In addition, the patient was homozygous for -3279T> G and A (TA) 7 TAA mutations in the UGT1A1 gene promoter. CONCLUSIONS: Our patient represents a case of digenic mixed hyperbilirubinemia-a distinct type of constitutive jaundice resulting from coinherited defects in ABCC2/MRP2 and UGT1A1 genes.
Gilbert_syndrome	UGT1A1	Positive	PMID:15985997	Rossi F, Francese M, Iodice RM, Falcone E, Vetrella S, Punzo F, De Vita S, Perrotta S: [Inherited disorders of bilirubin metabolism] . Minerva Pediatr. 2005 Apr;57(2):53-63. Jaundice in an infant or older child may reflect accumulation of either unconjugated or conjugated bilirubin and could be related to inherited bilirubin disorders. Three grades of inherited unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia are recognised in humans. This spectrum of disorders is distinguished primarily on the basis of the plasma bilirubin level, the response to phenobarbital administration, and the presence or absence of bilirubin glucoronides in bile. The enzyme responsible for the conjugation of bilirubin is the bilirubin uridine-diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT). Mutations in the gene encoding bilirubin-UGT (UGT1A1), lead to complete or partial inactivation of the enzyme causing the rare autosomal recessively inherited conditions, Crigler-Najjar syndrome type 1 (CN-1) and type 2 (CN-2). Gilbert syndrome (GS) is due to an insertional mutation at homozygous state of the TATAA element (seven TA repeats) of UGT1A1 producing a reduced level of expression of the gene. The association of GS with haemolytic anemias, e.g., Hereditary Spherocytosis (HS) or Congenital Dyserythropoietic Anemia type 2 (CDA 2), increase the hyperbilirubinemia level and the risk of cholelithiasis. Forms of chronic conjugated hyperbilirubinemia are Dubin-Johnson syndrome, Rotor syndrome, Alagille syndrome or arteriohepatic dysplasia, Wilson disease or hepatolenticular degeneration. Liver or liver cell transplantation is the therapy in some cases.
Gilbert_syndrome	glycosyltransferase	Positive	PMID:9630669	Yamamoto K, Sato H, Fujiyama Y, Doida Y, Bamba T: Contribution of two missense mutations (G71R and Y486D) of the bilirubin UDP glycosyltransferase (UGT1A1) gene to phenotypes of Gilbert's syndrome and Crigler-Najjar syndrome type II. Biochim Biophys Acta. 1998 Apr 28;1406(3):267-73. In our mutation analyses of bilirubin UDP glycosyltransferase (UGT1A1) gene, we encountered six patients with Crigler-Najjar syndrome type II who were double homozygotes for G71R and Y486D, a patient with Gilbert's syndrome who was a single homozygote for G71R and six patients with Gilbert's syndrome who were single heterozygote for G71R. To clarify the role of each mutation in the occurrence of the two syndromes, we made four mutant expression models. Relative UGT1A1 activity of a single homozygous model of G71R was 32.2+/-1.6% of normal, that of a single homozygous model of Y486D was 7.6+/-0.5%, that of a double homozygous model of G71R and Y486D was 6.2+/-1.6% and that of a heterozygous model of G71R was 60.2+/-3.5%. The decreased activities of the single homozygous model of G71R and the double homozygous model were at an appropriate level to be diagnosed as Gilbert's syndrome and CN-II, respectively. The activity of a single heterozygous model of G71R was somewhat high to develop to the phenotype of Gilbert's syndrome, suggesting the presence of additional factors for the etiology of Gilbert's syndrome.
Gilbert_syndrome	UGT1A	Positive	PMID:17426648	Kaplan M, Renbaum P, Vreman HJ, Wong RJ, Levy-Lahad E, Hammerman C, Stevenson DK: (TA) n UGT 1A1 Promoter Polymorphism: A Crucial Factor in the Pathophysiology of Jaundice in G-6-PD Deficient Neonates. Pediatr Res. 2007 Apr 5;. Increased heme catabolism has been reported in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD)-normal neonates who were also homozygous for (TA) 7/(TA) 7 (UGT1A1*28) uridine diphosphoglucuronate-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT) promoter polymorphism (Gilbert syndrome). As G-6-PD deficiency is associated with increased hemolysis, we hypothesized that in G-6-PD-deficient neonates who also have the (TA) 7/(TA) 7 UGT promoter genotype, steady-state hemolysis would be even further increased. Male G-6-PD-deficient neonates were sampled for plasma total bilirubin (PTB), blood carboxyhemoglobin corrected for inhaled carbon monoxide in ambient air (COHbc) (an index of heme catabolism), and UGT (TA) n promoter genotype determination and compared with previously published G-6-PD-normal neonates. Although COHbc values were higher in the G-6-PD-deficient than in the G-6-PD-normal cohorts (0.97 +/- 0.32% of total Hb (tHb) versus 0.76 +/- 0.19% of tHb, p PTB values were similar (9.2 +/- 3.4 mg/dL versus 8.9 +/- 3.0 mg/dL, respectively, p = 0.3). Within the G-6-PD-deficient group, although COHbc values were alike between the three UGT promoter genotypes, PTB was higher in the (TA) 7/(TA) 7 homozygotes (11.1 +/- 4.0 mg/dL) compared with (TA) 6/(TA) 7 heterozygotes (9.1 +/- 3.2 mg/dL, p = 0.03) and wild-type (TA) 6/(TA) 6 homozygotes (8.8 +/- 3.4 mg/dL, p = 0.02). In the steady state, similar rates of hemolysis, but increased PTB in the G-6-PD-deficient, (TA) 7/(TA) 7 homozygotes, imply that (TA) 7/(TA) 7 homozygosity is central to increased PTB.
Gilbert_syndrome	UGT1A	Positive	PMID:17058217	Lankisch TO, Moebius U, Wehmeier M, Behrens G, Manns MP, Schmidt RE, Strassburg CP: Gilbert's disease and atazanavir: from phenotype to UDP-glucuronosyltransferase haplotype. Hepatology. 2006 Nov;44(5):1324-32. Gilbert's disease leads to intermittent non-hemolytic hyperbilirubinemia by a reduction of hepatic bilirubin glucuronidation associated with the presence of the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1*28 polymorphism. It is considered benign because it does not result in hepatocellular damage. However, pharmacogenetic analyses have linked UGT1A1*28 to drug toxicity and cancer predisposition. The protease inhibitor atazanavir (ATV) is an inhibitor of hepatic UGT activity leading to hyperbilirubinemia in individual patients. Whether this is linked specifically to UGT1A1*28 or to more complex variants influencing glucuronidation is unclear. One hundred and six ATV-treated patients were characterized and genotyped for UGT1A1*28, the UGT1A3 (-66C) and UGT1A7 (-57G) promoter variants, and UGT1A7 (129K/131K). ATV treatment increased median bilirubin levels from 10 to 41 micromol/L (P = .001) with hyperbilirubinemia exceeding 43 micromol/L in 37%. Hyperbilirubinemia over 43 micromol/L was significantly associated not only with UGT1A1*28 but also with UGT1A3-66C, UGT1A7-57G, and UGT1A7 (129K/131K), although these variants do not naturally occur in linkage dysequilibrium in blood donors. Homozygous combinations of UGT1A1*28 with the other variants increased from 7.4% (normal bilirubin to 42 micromol/L) to 41% to 46.1% (43 to > 85 micromol/L), and 100% (> 85 micromol/L). All six patients with hyperbilirubinemia greater than 85 micromol/L were homozygous for all four variants identifying a haplotype inherited on a single allele. In conclusion, the genetic variant associated with Gilbert's disease is identified as part of a haplotype of four UGT1A variants spanning three genes at the UGT1A gene locus. This haplotype predisposes to hyperbilirubinemia in ATV treatment and may have an additional role as a pharmacogenomic risk factor for drug therapy.
Gilbert_syndrome	UGT1A	Positive	PMID:15716465	Lankisch TO, Vogel A, Eilermann S, Fiebeler A, Krone B, Barut A, Manns MP, Strassburg CP: Identification and characterization of a functional TATA box polymorphism of the UDP glucuronosyltransferase 1A7 gene. Mol Pharmacol. 2005 May;67(5):1732-9. Epub 2005 Feb 16. UDP glucuronosyltransferases (UGT) detoxify bilirubin and therapeutic drugs, a process influenced by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in their structural genes and promoter elements. UGT1A1*28 is a functional UGT promoter polymorphism associated with Gilbert's disease and severe irinotecan toxicity, which also occurs in the absence of UGT1A1*28. The aim of this study was to identify and characterize UGT promoter variants relevant for irinotecan detoxification. Recombinant UGT1A proteins were analyzed for irinotecan metabolite glucuronidation by UGT activity assays. In 427 healthy blood donors and 71 homozygous UGT1A1*28 carriers, the 5'-untranslated region of the UGT1A7 gene locus was studied. An SNP was detected by allelic discrimination and characterized by reporter gene experiments. A novel -57 T--> G SNP with a gene frequency of 0.39 in healthy blood donors was identified in the putative TATA box of the UGT1A7 gene, reducing promoter activity to 30%. It is in linkage dysequilibrium with a variant of the UGT1A7 first exon that is present in the reduced-activity UGT1A7*3 and UGT1A7*4 alleles. Homozygous UGT1A1*28 carriers simultaneously carried this variant in 97%. We identified a novel reduced-function TATA box SNP of the UGT1A7 gene that catalyzes irinotecan metabolite detoxification. Its association with variants of the UGT1A1 promoter and UGT1A7 gene may influence irinotecan metabolism. Our finding emphasizes the importance of combinations of structural and regulatory gene polymorphisms that may be useful as markers of drug toxicity.

Clin Cancer Res. 2004 Aug 1;10(15):5151-9. PURPOSE: We wanted to assess polymorphisms in the uridine diphosphoglucuronosyl transferase 1A1 (UGT 1A1) gene: the TATA box polymorphism and UGT 1A1 G71R and Y486D mutations in the coding sequence, the main mutations characterizing Gilbert's syndrome, as predictors of severe toxic event occurrence after irinotecan (CPT-11) administration. Therefore, we set up a rapid, sensitive, and reliable technique in routine practice to detect before CPT-11 treatment, the at-risk patients. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Seventy-five patients with advanced colorectal cancer and treated with CPT-11 and 5-fluorouracil, entered the study. We used the Pyrosequencing technology a real-time sequencing method, to detect the UGT 1A1 TATA box polymorphisms and mutations in the coding regions. Patients were also assessed for both biochemical and clinical evaluation and tolerance to treatment. RESULTS: No G71R and Y486D mutations were found in our population. Frequencies for UGT 1A1 TATA box polymorphisms were 41, 47, and 9% for wild-type 6/6, heterozygous 6/7, and Gilbert's syndrome 7/7, respectively. Tolerance to treatment decreased with increased number of TA repeat with 71% of the patients in 7/7 group who experienced grade 3/4 toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: The method we set up is suitable for the detection of UGT 1A1 polymorphism in routine practice before irinotecan treatment. It could help to detect the patients homozygous or heterozygous for Gilbert's syndrome, at-risk of CPT 11-induced toxicity, and thus could help to individualize the dose to optimize efficacy and limit toxicity.
Gilbert_syndrome	UGT1A	Positive	PMID:12732365	Kohle C, Mohrle B, Munzel PA, Schwab M, Wernet D, Badary OA, Bock KW: Frequent co-occurrence of the TATA box mutation associated with Gilbert's syndrome (UGT1A1*28) with other polymorphisms of the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase-1 locus (UGT1A6*2 and UGT1A7*3) in Caucasians and Egyptians. Biochem Pharmacol. 2003 May 1;65(9):1521-7. Polymorphisms of drug metabolizing enzymes are frequently associated with diseases and side effects of drugs. Recently, a TATA box mutation of UGT1A1 (UGT1A1*28), a common genotype leading to Gilbert's syndrome, and several missense mutations of other UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1 (UGT1) family members have been described. Furthermore, co-occurrence of UGT1A1*28 and UGT1A6*2 has been observed. In order to elucidate the basis for co-occurrence of UGT1 mutations, fluorescence resonance energy transfer techniques were developed for rapid determination of polymorphisms of three UGT isoforms (UGT1A1*28, 1A6*2, and 1A7*2/*3). Hundred healthy Caucasians and 50 Egyptians were genotyped. All genotypes followed the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Only three major haplotypes were found, including a haplotype consisting of allelic variants of all three isoforms (29% in Caucasians and 22% in Egyptians), all leading to reduced UGT activity. Frequent haplotypes containing several UGT1 allelic variants should be taken into account in studies on the association between diseases, abnormal drug reactions, and UGT1 family polymorphisms.
Gilbert_syndrome	UGT1A	Positive	PMID:12685510	Kanou M, Saeki K, Kato TA, Takahashi K, Mizutani T: Study of in vitro glucuronidation of hydroxyquinolines with bovine liver microsomes. Fundam Clin Pharmacol. 2002 Dec;16(6):513-7. Glucuronidation of drugs by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) is a major phase II conjugation reaction. Defects in UGT are associated with Crigler-Najjar syndrome and Gilbert's syndrome with severe hyperbilirubinaemias and jaundice. We analysed the reactivities of some hydroxyquinoline derivatives, which are naturally produced from quinoline by cytochrome P450. The analyses were carried out using a microassay system for UGT activity in bovine liver microsomes in the range 0.5-100 pmol/assay with the highly sensitive radio-image analyser Fuji BAS2500 (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan). 3-Hydroxylquinoline is a good substrate for glucuronidation, and the relative Kcat values were 3.1-fold higher than the values for p-nitrophenol. 5,6-Dihydroquinoline-5,6-trans-diol gave a similar Km value to that of 3-hydroxyquinoline, but the Vmax value was approximately 1/15 of that of p-nitrophenol and showed weak reactivity. Quinoline N-oxide gave a low Vmax value and showed marginal activity. The Kcat values of 6-hydroxyquinoline and 5-hydroxyquinoline were 2.1- and 1.2-fold higher than that of p-nitrophenol, respectively. Fluoroquinoline (FQ) derivatives, such as 3FQ, 7.8diFQ and 6,7,8triFQ, did not show any substrate activities. These results suggest that there are therapeutic problems in administration of some quinoline drugs to patients with jaundice.
Gilbert_syndrome	UGT1A	Positive	PMID:12499798	Kim YH, Yeon JE, Jung GM, Kim HJ, Kim JS, Byun KS, Bak YT, Lee CH: [A study of polymorphism in UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1 (UGT-1A1) promoter gene in Korean patients with Gilbert's syndrome]. Taehan Kan Hakhoe Chi. 2002 Jun;8(2):132-8. BACKGROUND/AIMS: Hepatic glucuronidating activity, essential for efficient biliary excretion of bilirubin, is reduced to about 30 percent of normal in patients with Gilbert's syndrome. Patients with Gilbert's syndrome have an additional TA insertion in the A (TA) TAA of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1 (UGT-1A1) promoter gene. This results in reduced frequency and accuracy of transcription initiation and enzyme activity. The frequency and location of the mutation vary according to races. This study was done to determine the UGT-1A1 promoter gene mutation in Korean cases of Gilbert's syndrome. METHODS: Promoter regions of the gene for bilirubin UGT-1A1 in twelve patients with Gilbert's syndrome and twenty healthy subjects (controls) were sequenced. RESULTS: 1) Among twelve Gilbert's syndrome five patients were homozygous for A (TA) 6/6TAA, two were homozygous for A (TA) 7/7TAA, and the other five were heterozygous for A (TA) 6/7TAA. The prevalence of A (TA) TAA mutation was 58.3 percent. 2) Among twenty healthy subjects seventeen were homozygous for A (TA) 6/6TAA, one was homozygous for A (TA) 7/7TAA, and two were heterozygous for A (TA) 6/7TAA. The prevalence of A (TA) TAA mutation was 15 percent. 3) The prevalence of A (TA) TAA mutation in Gilbert's syndrome patients was significantly higher than in the controls (p=0.018). CONCLUSION: Although the prevalence of A (TA) TAA mutation in Korean patients with Gilbert's syndrome is significantly higher than in the controls, the mutations of the promoter region of UGT-1A1 gene appear not to be the main or sole cause in Gilbert's syndrome in Korea since the prevalence of A (TA) TAA mutation is not so high. Further studies to determine the relationship between other UGT-1A1 gene mutation and Gilbert's syndrome in Korea are needed.

Hepatology. 2002 Apr;35(4):905-11. Hemolysis may contribute to hyperbilirubinemia in Gilbert's syndrome. The authors examined blood carboxyhemoglobin corrected for inspired CO (COHbc) to index heme catabolism and serum conjugated bilirubin fractions to reflect bilirubin conjugation. Both parameters were related to UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT) promoter polymorphism, associated with Gilbert's syndrome, in term male newborns. COHbc was expressed as percentage of total hemoglobin, and total conjugated bilirubin (TCB) value as a percentage of serum total bilirubin (STB), (TCB/STB [%]). A production/conjugation index, COHbc/(TCB/STB [%]), represented bilirubin production divided by conjugation. UGT promoter genotype was designated according to the number of promoter TA insertions in each allele: 6/6, homozygous normal; 6/7, heterozygous; 7/7, homozygous variant. STB and COHbc values were higher in the 7/7 subgroup than the other counterparts (P (TCB/STB [%]) was higher in the 7/7 than either the 6/6 or 6/7 subsets (1.93 [1.31-2.88] vs. 0.85 [0.51-1.72] and 0.84 [0.53-1.87], respectively; P UGT promoter polymorphism was associated with increased blood COHbc values (unexpected finding) as well as diminished serum total conjugated bilirubin ratios (expected finding). The increased hemolysis may contribute to the pathogenesis of increased STB values seen in Gilbert's syndrome, and exacerbate neonatal hyperbilirubinemia associated with the promoter polymorphism.

J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2001 Oct;23(7):448-51. PURPOSE: Genetic mutations in the uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucuronosyltransferase 1A (UGT1A) enzyme promoter have been associated with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia and Gilbert syndrome. The effects of UGT1A promoter polymorphisms on serum bilirubin levels and symptomatic gallstone formation were studied in a cohort of children with sickle cell anemia (SCA). METHODS: The UGT1A promoter genotype was deterrmined for 115 consecutive children with SCA. Steady-state laboratory parameters and previous cholecystectomy for symptomatic gallstones were recorded retrospectively, then analyzed according to UGT1A genotype. RESULTS: Children with SCA had a lower frequency of the normal (TA) 6 UGT1A promoter allele (0.413) than the abnormal (TA) 7 allele (0.461). A previously described shorter (TA) 5 allele (frequency 0.074) and longer (TA) 8 allele (frequency 0.052) were also observed. Children with the 7/7 UGT1A genotype had a significantly higher mean bilirubin level (5.8 +/- 3.1 mg/dL) than those with the 6/6 (2.4 +/- 0.8 mg/dL) or 6/7 genotype (3.0 +/- 1.1 mg/dL; P UGT1A promoter significantly influences serum bilirubin levels and the development of symptomatic cholelithiasis in children with SCA. The UGT1A promoter polymorphisms represent an important nonglobin genetic modifier of clinical disease expression in SCA.
Gilbert_syndrome	UGT1A	Positive	PMID:11857560	Fertrin KY, Goncalves MS, Saad ST, Costa FF: Frequencies of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1 (UGT1A1) gene promoter polymorphisms among distinct ethnic groups from Brazil. Am J Med Genet. 2002 Mar 1;108(2):117-9. A polymorphism in the promoter region of the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1 (UGT1A) gene is associated with Gilbert syndrome (GS), a benign form of mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. We genotyped 157 individuals from Brazil, comprising 71 Caucasians, 54 African-derived subjects, and 32 Parakana Indians. Frequencies of the alelle (TA)(7) associated with GS found in this study were 0.324, 0.407, and 0.328, respectively. The genotype frequencies differed significantly between Caucasians and African-derived individuals. The high frequencies of (TA)(7) polymorphism among the three groups confirm previous data that this polymorphism is very ancient and appears to be distributed throughout the world.
McLeod_syndrome	pantothenate-kinase	Negative	PMID:17210889	Walker RH, Jung HH, Dobson-Stone C, Rampoldi L, Sano A, Tison F, Danek A: Neurologic phenotypes associated with acanthocytosis. Neurology. 2007 Jan 9;68(2):92-8. The term "neuroacanthocytosis" is normally used to refer to autosomal recessive chorea-acanthocytosis and X-linked McLeod syndrome, but there are other movement disorders in which erythrocyte acanthocytosis may also be seen, such as Huntington disease-like 2 and pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration. Disorders of serum lipoproteins such as Bassen-Kornzweig disease form a distinct group of neuroacanthocytosis syndromes in which ataxia is observed, but movement disorders are not seen. Genetic testing has enabled us to distinguish between these disorders, even when there are considerable similarities between phenotypes. Improved detection is important for accurate genetic counseling, for monitoring for complications, and, it is hoped, for implementing causal treatments, once these become available. As in other neurodegenerative conditions, animal models are a promising strategy for the development of such therapies.
McLeod_syndrome	interferon-gamma	Negative	PMID:8084323	Kantar A, Oggiano N, Gabbianelli R, Fabrizzi G, Giorgi PL: Successful interferon gamma therapy in a patient with X-linked chronic granulomatous disease, McLeod syndrome and hyper-IgE. Minerva Pediatr. 1994 Apr;46(4):157-60. Case report. Recent studies have shown clinical benefit resulting from recombinant interferon gamma (rIFN-gamma) therapy in patients affected by chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), which represents an important adjunct to conventional therapy. In order to evaluate the effect of interferon gamma therapy, we investigated clinical and haematological parameters in a child with X-linked CGD, McLeod phenotype (kell negative) and hyper-IgE, before and after 8 months of therapy. Our results show no significant effect of rIFN-gamma on the respiratory burst of peripheral polymorphonuclear leukocytes. This notwithstanding, we observed improved clinical and haematological conditions. These results support the view that interferon gamma may benefit these subjects by influencing oxygen-independent antimicrobial activity or other immunological parameters.
McLeod_syndrome	Kell-blood-group	Positive	PMID:11284140	Stevenson VL, Hardie RJ: Acanthocytosis and neurological disorders. J Neurol. 2001 Feb;248(2):87-94. Acanthocytosis occurs because of ultrastructural abnormalities of the erythrocyte membranous skeleton resulting in reduced membrane fluidity. At least three hereditary neurological conditions are associated with it, although as yet the pathogenesis of the neurological features is unknown. In abetalipoproteinaemia, an autosomal recessive condition, vitamin E deficiency results in a progressive spinocerebellar syndrome associated with peripheral neuropathy and retinitis pigmentosa. Neuroacanthocytosis is also probably an autosomal recessive condition and is characterised by chorea, orofaciolingual dyskinesia, dysarthria, areflexia, seizures and dementia. McLeod syndrome is an X-linked recessive disorder usually presenting in males as a benign myopathy with areflexia, in association with a particular abnormality of expression of Kell blood group antigens. However, occasionally the neurological features are more severe and indistinguishable from those of neuroacanthocytosis. Recent advances in molecular genetics may assist better understanding of the disease mechanisms and the search for more effective treatments.
McLeod_syndrome	Kell-blood-group	Positive	PMID:11032622	Barnett MH, Yang F, Iland H, Pollard JD: Unusual muscle pathology in McLeod syndrome. J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry. 2000 Nov;69(5):655-7. Muscle pathology in McLeod syndrome is usually mild; patchy necrotic or regenerating fibres, occasional internal nuclei, and the absence of an inflammatory cell infiltrate are the usual findings. We report on a 29 year old man presenting with chronic fatiguability and excessive sweating in whom an open quadriceps muscle biopsy demonstrated grouped necrotic fibres accompanied by striking patchy mononuclear cell infiltrates. The diagnosis of McLeod syndrome was made on the basis of red blood cell acanthocytosis, raised serum creatine kinase, and weak expression of Kell blood group antigens. The quadriceps muscle infiltrate consisted principally of histologically typical macrophages. These cells had prominent nucleoli, displayed numerous mitoses, and were strongly CD68+. A small population of typical CD3+, CD43+ lymphocytes was also present. In addition, a small population of large atypical CD3+ cells was noted. Immunoperoxidase stains for CD20, CD30, CD79a, and CD56 were negative. Immunocytochemical studies for the common muscular dystrophies were normal. The muscle biopsy findings highlight a potential for confusion of this condition with idiopathic polymyositis. The expanding range of muscle pathology reported in McLeod syndrome, to which this case adds, may reflect variable involvement of the XK gene on chromosome Xp21, or of the adjacent loci of Duchenne muscular dystrophy and chronic granulomatous disease.

J Neurol Sci. 1999 Jun 15;166(1):36-9. A 51-year-old man developed weakness and muscle atrophy in the legs at the age of 41, later followed by choreiform involuntary movements. Neurological and laboratory examinations revealed severe muscle weakness and atrophy, and areflexia in all the extremities, acanthocytosis and an elevated serum creatine kinase level. Together with these findings, the weak expression of Kell blood group antigens and the absence of the Kx antigen led to a definite diagnosis of McLeod syndrome for his condition. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed marked atrophy of the head of the caudate nuclei. Although immunocytochemical analysis of dystrophin in muscle specimens from our patient revealed normal staining, we found prominent fiber size variability, central nuclei, and connective tissue proliferation as well as necrotic and regenerating fibers, which are as a whole compatible with the myopathology of muscular dystrophy. Moreover, muscle computerized tomography of the lower extremities revealed the 'selectivity pattern' characteristically reported in muscular dystrophies including Duchenne type muscular dystrophy. The muscular symptoms and pathology in McLeod syndrome have been reported to be mild, but the present case clearly shows that the muscular features in this condition may be much more severe than previously thought.

A 50-year-old man with the rare McLeod syndrome, associated with glomerular lesion to the end stage of chronic renal failure and death, is reported. McLeod syndrome is an X-linked recessive disorder on the basis of abnormal expression of the Kell blood group antigens and absence of erythrocyte surface Kx antigen. Most often the clinical and pathological findings are retinitis pigmentosa to blindness, progressive chronic neuropathy, cortical atrophy, dilated cardiomyopathy, and glomerular lesion with chronic renal failure. Among the laboratory parameters the most important are very low level of cholesterol and triglycerides, then various numbers of acanthocytes in peripheral blood smears and sometimes in urine (as in our case).

The past year has seen further advances in our understanding of the molecular biology of the most abundant erythrocyte proteins associated with blood group antigens (band 3, the glycophorins, and the Rh antigen-related proteins). There have also been several important developments in the structural and functional identification of some of the less abundant antigens. These developments include the association of the Colton antigens with the erythrocyte water channel, aquaporin; the cloning of the Duffy antigen and its identification as a chemokine receptor; the cloning of the Kx antigen, which is associated with McLeod syndrome; and the cloning of the LW, CD47, and Xga antigens.

McLeod syndrome is an Xp21-linked Kell blood group variant due to lack of erythrocyte protein Kx with associated RBC membrane dysfunction such as acanthocytosis. A man with this syndrome developed chorea and slight neuropsychological impairment. He had caudate atrophy on cerebral imaging and reduced striatal dopamine D2-receptor binding on single-photon emission computed tomography. Since Xp21 was partly deleted in the patient, the missing gene product (possibly Kx) may be essential for the integrity of the striatum.

Eur J Biochem. 1995 Mar 15;228(3):931-4. A 37-kDa protein was immunopurified from human erythrocytes as a complex with a monoclonal antibody directed against the Kell blood group protein of 93 kDa. A rabbit antibody raised against the purified complex reacted on a Western blot with the 93-kDa and 37-kDa proteins and was able to immunoprecipitate the 37-kDa component from K0 erythrocytes which express large amount of the Kx antigen, but not from erythrocytes of patients suffering from McLeod syndrome, a X-linked disorder in which the Kx antigen is lacking. Additional studies have shown that the 37-kDa protein is not glycosylated, and permitted the sequence of the 22 first N-terminal amino acids to be established. This sequence was identical to the predicted protein product of the XK gene cloned recently, which is deleted or mutated in McLeod patients [Ho, M., Chelly, J., Carter, N., Danek, A., Crocker, P. & Monaco, A. P. (1994) Cell 77, 869-880]. Our findings provide strong evidence that the 37-kDa red cell membrane protein is identical to the Kx protein produced by the XK structural gene and demonstrate that Kx and Kell proteins are two subunits expressed as a complex hold by disulfide bond (s) at the red cell surface.
McLeod_syndrome	Kell-blood-group	Positive	PMID:6685553	Swash M, Schwartz MS, Carter ND, Heath R, Leak M, Rogers KL: Benign X-linked myopathy with acanthocytes (McLeod syndrome). Brain. 1983 Sep;106 (Pt 3):717-33. Its relationship to X-linked muscular dystrophy. Two healthy men with McLeod syndrome, a rare X-linked recessive phenotype characterized by acanthocytosis and weakened red blood cell antigenicity in the Kell blood group system, have been investigated. Both men showed raised blood creatine kinase levels, with myopathic EMG abnormalities. Biopsies of the quadriceps muscle showed the features of an active myopathy although there was no clinical evidence of muscular abnormality. The combination of the association of membrane abnormalities in red blood cells and a myopathy in both McLeod phenotype and Duchenne muscular dystrophy suggests that these syndromes may be due to related genetic abnormalities. The genetic locus for McLeod phenotype is situated near the end of the short arm of the X chromosome. The locus for Duchenne muscular dystrophy is unknown but it has been postulated that it is also situated on the short arm of the X chromosome at Xp 21. The occurrence of a subclinical X-linked myopathy with acanthocytosis (McLeod phenotype) thus raises the possibility of a new approach to genetic investigations in Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and in the related milder forms of this disease.
McLeod_syndrome	Kell-blood-group	Positive	PMID:2687930	Hardie RJ: Acanthocytosis and neurological impairment--a review. Q J Med. 1989 Apr;71(264):291-306. Acanthocytes have a distinct morphology and are not normally found in peripheral blood. They occur in association with at least three neurological syndromes. In abetalipoproteinaemia, a progressive spinocerebellar ataxia and retinopathy occurs secondary to malabsorption of vitamin E. Cases with chorea are often familial, with orofacial dyskinesia and an axonal neuropathy causing areflexia and muscle wasting. Areflexia and a subclinical myopathy also occur in the McLeod syndrome, in which there is abnormal expression of Kell blood group antigens. The exact mechanism of acanthocytosis in each disorder remains uncertain: passive changes in membrane lipids, surface receptor/ligand interactions, and a primary membrane defect are among the possibilities.

Mov Disord. 2007 Apr 30;22(6):848-52. Chorea-acanthocytosis (ChAc) is a hereditary disease characterized by involuntary movements and amyotrophy with elevation of serum creatine kinase. Although skeletal muscle involvement in ChAc has been suggested, the mechanism remains unclear. To investigate chorein abnormalities of the skeletal muscles of ChAc patients with an apparently heterozygous VPS13A mutation compared with those of other hereditary choreic diseases, we performed histological and immunohistochemical studies of the skeletal muscles from 3 ChAc, 1 Huntington's disease (HD), 1 McLeod syndrome (MLS), and 1 normal control (NC) with 2 originally generated anti-chorein antibodies. Chorein immunoreactivities in HD, MLS, and NC were found linearly along the sarcolemma and appeared as speckles in the sarcoplasma, but those in ChAc were uneven and discontinuous along the sarcolemmas and increased in the sarcoplasma especially in type I fibers. This histological observation suggests chorein abnormalities of skeletal muscles might be associated with primary involvement of skeletal muscles in this disorder.

Ann Neurol. 2004 Aug;56(2):299-302. Chorea-acanthocytosis (ChAc) is a severe, neurodegenerative disorder that shares clinical features with Huntington's disease and McLeod syndrome. It is caused by mutations in VPS13A, which encodes a large protein called chorein. Using antichorein antisera, we found expression of chorein in all human cells analyzed. However, chorein expression was absent or noticeably reduced in ChAc patient cells, but not McLeod syndrome and Huntington's disease cells. This suggests that loss of chorein expression is a diagnostic feature of ChAc.

Ann Neurol. 2001 Dec;50(6):755-64. McLeod syndrome is caused by mutations of XK, an X-chromosomal gene of unknown function. Originally defined as a peculiar Kell blood group variant, the disease affects multiple organs, including the nervous system, but is certainly underdiagnosed. We analyzed the mutations and clinical findings of 22 affected men, aged 27 to 72 years. Fifteen different XK mutations were found, nine of which were novel, including the one of the eponymous case McLeod. Their common result is predicted absence or truncation of the XK protein. All patients showed elevated levels of muscle creatine phosphokinase, but clinical myopathy was less common. A peripheral neuropathy with areflexia was found in all but 2 patients. The central nervous system was affected in 15 patients, as obvious from the occurrence of seizures, cognitive impairment, psychopathology, and choreatic movements. Neuroimaging emphasized the particular involvement of the basal ganglia, which was also detected in 1 asymptomatic young patient. Most features develop with age, mainly after the fourth decade. The resemblance of McLeod syndrome with Huntington's disease and with autosomal recessive chorea-acanthocytosis suggests that the corresponding proteins--XK, huntingtin, and chorein--might belong to a common pathway, the dysfunction of which causes degeneration of the basal ganglia.

Hum Mol Genet. 1995 Dec;4(12):2339-46. X-linked retinitis pigmentosa (XLRP) is characterized by retinal degeneration with night blindness and progressive reduction of the visual fields. By linkage and deletion analysis a gene locus (RP3) has been mapped to the short arm of the X chromosome between the genes CYBB and OTC. Analysis of transcript in this region has revealed a gene which is abundantly expressed in human retina and encodes a putative membrane protein with significant homologies to short consensus repeat (SCR/sushi) domains known from selections and complement proteins. The gene termed SRPX (sushi-repeat-containing protein, x chromosome) is deleted in an RP patient who also suffers from chronic granulomatous disease and McLeod syndrome. A 75 kb deletion removing exon 1 of the gene was also found in two brothers of a second XLRP family. However, no further functionally significant mutations were detected by SSCP screening of all 10 exons in 34 unrelated XLRP patients nor by full length RT-PCR sequencing in two RP3 families. The role of this highly conserved retinal gene in the pathogenesis of RP therefore remains to be determined.

Ann Hum Genet. 2000 Jul;64(Pt 4):341-7. There is good evidence from linkage analysis and mouse model knockouts that the endothelin-1 gene (EDN1) is a good candidate for non-syndromic orofacial cleft (OFC) disease. EDN1 maps to the chromosomal region of the OFC1 locus in 6p23. Therefore we have examined three other candidate genes in the endothelin pathway (ECE1, EDNRA and EDNRB, which map to chromosomes 1, 4 and 13 respectively) in a linkage study of 9 families with OFC, where the disorder is not linked to chromosome 6p23. The total lod score for these 9 multiplex families never exceeded -2.00 and thus our data suggest that EDN1 and related genes are not involved in non-syndromic familial OFC.

Am J Hum Genet. 2007 Jul;81(1):180-8. Epub 2007 May 18. Nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (NSCL/P) is one of the most common congenital facial defects, with an incidence of 1 in 700-1,000 live births among individuals of European descent. Several linkage and association studies of NSCL/P have suggested numerous candidate genes and genomic regions. A genomewide linkage analysis of a large multigenerational family (UR410) with NSCL/P was performed using a single-nucleotide-polymorphism array. Nonparametric linkage (NPL) analysis provided significant evidence of linkage for marker rs728683 on chromosome 18q21.1 (NPL=43.33 and P=.000061; nonparametric LOD=3.97 and P=.00001). Parametric linkage analysis with a dominant mode of inheritance and reduced penetrance resulted in a maximum LOD score of 3.61 at position 47.4 Mb on chromosome 18q21.1. Haplotype analysis with informative crossovers defined a 5.7-Mb genomic region spanned by proximal marker rs1824683 (42,403,918 bp) and distal marker rs768206 (48,132,862 bp). Thus, a novel genomic region on 18q21.1 was identified that most likely harbors a high-risk variant for NSCL/P in this family; we propose to name this locus "OFC11" (orofacial cleft 11).

Cleft Palate Craniofac J. 1998 Jul;35(4):366-70. OBJECTIVE: We previously demonstrated a strong association between periconceptional maternal cigarette smoking, infant transforming growth factor-alpha (TGFa) genotype, and risk of orofacial clefts. Because serum folate may be decreased by cigarette smoking and because maternal periconceptional use of multivitamins containing folic acid has been associated with a reduced risk of clefting, we explored whether a potential relation existed between infant TGFa genotype, maternal multivitamin use, and risk of orofacial cleft phenotypes. DESIGN: Data were derived from a population-based case-control study of fetuses and live-born infants among a cohort of 1987 to 1989 California births (n = 548,844). Information concerning periconceptional multivitamin use was obtained via telephone interviews with mothers of 731 (84.7% of eligible) orofacial cleft case infants, and of 734 (78.2%) nonmalformed control infants. DNA was obtained from newborn screening bloodspots and genotyped for the Taql polymorphism of TGFa. Among infants of interviewed mothers, genotypes were available for 571 (78.1%) case infants and 640 (87.2%) control infants. SETTING: The study encompassed all hospitals in selected California counties. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The main outcome measures were the risks of specific cleft phenotypes among infants with uncommon TGFa genotypes and whose mothers did not use multivitamins periconceptionally. RESULTS: Compared with infants homozygous for the common TGFa genotype and whose mothers used multivitamins, increased clefting risks were observed for infants with the A2 genotype (homozygous or heterozygous) and whose mothers did not use multivitamins. Risk estimates were 3.0 (1.4-6.6 [95% confidence interval]) for isolated cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CLP), 2.4 (0.69-11.6) for multiple CLP, 2.6 (0.97-7.7) for isolated cleft palate (CP), 4.2 (1.3-16.2) for multiple CP, and 8.1 (2.6-27.7) for "known-syndrome" clefts. Clefting risks for infants with the A2 genotype and whose mothers used multivitamins were substantially smaller, as were the risks for infants with the A1 genotype whose mothers did not use multivitamins. CONCLUSION: These data provide preliminary evidence for a gene-nutrient interaction in risk of clefting.

An allelic association between the transforming growth factor alpha gene (TGFA) situated in the chromosome 2p13 region and nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate, also named orofacial cleft (OFC), was found in several population studies. However, no linkage between gene and malformation has shown up until now, probably due to the presence of genetic heterogeneity and the small sample size analyzed. Previously, we employed a collection of 38 OFC families to demonstrate linkage to the 6p23 chromosome region with the presence of genetic heterogeneity. In the present study we tested whether, in the same sample, linkage between OFC and markers on 2p13 could be determined. Evidence for genetic heterogeneity in our family set was apparent, by both pairwise and multipoint linkage analyses. Moreover, lod scores > 3 were found for marker D2S378 when families linked to the 6p23 markers were analyzed. Taken together these results indicate a role for the TGFA, or for another gene physically close to it, and suggest an interaction between two different genes, OFC1 and OFC2, mapped in 6p23 and 2p13, respectively, in the development of the cleft.
Orofacial_cleft	IRF6	Negative	PMID:17564963	Shi M, Umbach DM, Weinberg CR: Identification of Risk-Related Haplotypes with the Use of Multiple SNPs from Nuclear Families. Am J Hum Genet. 2007 Jul;81(1):53-66. Epub 2007 May 15. Family-based association studies offer robustness to population stratification and can provide insight into maternally mediated and parent-of-origin effects. Usually, such studies investigate multiple markers covering a gene or chromosomal region of interest. We propose a simple and general method to test the association of a disease trait with multiple, possibly linked SNP markers and, subsequently, to nominate a set of "risk-haplotype-tagging alleles." Our test, the max_Z (2) test, uses only the genotypes of affected individuals and their parents without requiring the user to either know or assign haplotypes and their phases. It also accommodates sporadically missing SNP data. In the spirit of the pedigree disequilibrium test, our procedure requires only a vector of differences with expected value 0 under the null hypothesis. To enhance power against a range of alternatives when genotype data are complete, we also consider a method for combining multiple tests; here, we combine max_Z (2) and Hotelling's T (2). To facilitate discovery of risk-related haplotypes, we develop a simple procedure for nominating risk-haplotype-tagging alleles. Our procedures can also be used to study maternally mediated genetic effects and to explore imprinting. We compare the statistical power of several competing testing procedures through simulation studies of case-parents triads, whose diplotypes are simulated on the basis of draws from the HapMap-based known haplotypes of four genes. In our simulations, the max_Z (2) test and the max_TDT (transmission/disequilibrium test) proposed by McIntyre et al. perform almost identically, but max_Z (2), unlike max_TDT, extends directly to the investigation of maternal effects. As an illustration, we reanalyze data from a previously reported orofacial cleft study, to now investigate both fetal and maternal effects of the IRF6 gene.
Orofacial_cleft	IRF6	Negative	PMID:15013698	Gatta V, Scarciolla O, Cupaioli M, Palka C, Chiesa PL, Stuppia L: A novel mutation of the IRF6 gene in an Italian family with Van der Woude syndrome. Mutat Res. 2004 Mar 22;547(1-2):49-53. Van der Woude syndrome (VWS) is the most common type of syndromic orofacial cleft, being characterised by variable association of lower lip pits, cleft lip and cleft palate. VWS is transmitted in an autosomal dominant manner, with high penetrance and variable expressivity, and a gene for this disease has been mapped in 1q32-q41. Very recently, mutations of the interferon regulatory factor 6 (IRF6) gene have been found in VWS patients, suggesting that this gene plays an important role in the orofacial development. We report a novel mutation of the IRF6 in an Italian family with six members affected by VWS with different expression. This mutation, the W217X, produces a stop codon within exon 6 of the IRF6 gene, with loss of the SMIR domain of the IRF6 protein.

Orofacial_cleft	F13A	Positive	PMID:2888553	Eiberg H, Bixler D, Nielsen LS, Conneally PM, Mohr J: Suggestion of linkage of a major locus for nonsyndromic orofacial cleft with F13A and tentative assignment to chromosome 6. Clin Genet. 1987 Aug;32(2):129-32. A Danish material of 58 pedigrees with nonsyndromic orofacial cleft, selected out of a comprehensive Danish material for suggestiveness of autosomal dominant inheritance, was studied for linkage with 42 non-DNA polymorphic marker systems. Both cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL (P)) and cleft lip alone (CP) were, for the purpose of linkage analysis, scored as if they were due to an autosomal dominant gene with complete penetrance. The highest lod score was with the blood clotting factor XIIIA (F13A): for males alone z = 3.40 at theta = 0.00, for females alone z = 0.30 at theta = 0.21, and for these together z = 3.66 at at theta = 0.00 for males and 0.26 for females. Since F13A is known to be located distally on chromosome 6, we tentatively assign a major locus for orofacial cleft to this region. Since both CL (P) and CP pedigrees contribute to the positive score, the question arises whether this locus carries two cleft alleles.

Birth Defects Res A Clin Mol Teratol. 2004 Nov;70(11):846-52. BACKGROUND: Periconceptional supplementation of multivitamins that include folic acid have been shown to prevent several birth defects, including neural tube defects and orofacial clefts. We investigated whether polymorphic variants of fetal acetyl-N-transferase 1 (NAT1), an enzyme involved in the catabolism of folates, differentially interacted with maternal multivitamin use during early pregnancy to alter the risk of delivering an infant with an orofacial cleft malformation. METHODS: Using a large population-based case-control study, we genotyped 421 California infants born with an isolated cleft and 299 controls for two NAT1 polymorphisms. RESULTS: Compared to the homozygous wild-type genotypes, odds ratios for isolated cleft lip with/without cleft palate were slightly increased among infants who were homozygous for the variant alleles of NAT1 1088 and 1095. For isolated cleft palate, no similar associations with these two NAT1 variants were observed. For NAT1 1088 genotypes, we did not observe any differential risks for clefts related to maternal multivitamin intake. For NAT1 1095 genotypes, however, we found a two-fold higher risk for isolated cleft lip with/without cleft palate among infants who were homozygous for the variant allele and whose mothers did not take multivitamins during early pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: We found evidence suggestive of an interaction between the NAT1 1095 polymorphism and lack of maternal multivitamin use that increased risks of isolated cleft lip with/without cleft palate.

Epidemiology. 2004 Mar;15(2):150-6. BACKGROUND: Orofacial clefts are etiologically heterogeneous malformations. One probable cause is maternal smoking during pregnancy. The effect of maternal smoking may be modified by genes involved in biotransformation of toxic compounds derived from tobacco. We investigated whether polymorphic variants of fetal acetyl-N-transferases 1 (NAT1) and 2 (NAT2) interact with maternal cigarette smoking during early pregnancy to increase the risk of delivering an infant with an orofacial cleft. METHODS: In a California population-based case-control study, we genotyped 421 infants born with an isolated cleft and 299 nonmal-formed controls for 2 NAT1 and 3 NAT2 single nucleotide polymorphisms RESULTS: Although smoking was independently associated with increased risks for both isolated cleft lip +/- cleft palate and isolated cleft palate, no independent associations were found for NAT1 1088 or 1095 genotypes or for NAT2 acetylator status. However, the infant NAT1 1088 and 1095 polymorphisms were strongly associated with the risk of clefts among smoking mothers; infants with NAT1 1088 genotype AA versus TT (odds ratio [OR] = 3.9; 95% confidence interval = 1.1-17.2) and with NAT1 1095 genotype AA versus CC (OR = 4.2; 1.2-18.0). Infant NAT2 acetylator status did not appreciably affect susceptibility of the fetus to the teratogenic effects of maternal smoking. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that maternal smoking during pregnancy may increase risk for orofacial clefts particularly among smokers whose fetuses have polymorphic variants of NAT1, an enzyme involved in phase II detoxification of tobacco smoke constituents.

Orofacial_cleft	NAT2	Negative	PMID:12397635	van Rooij IA, Groenen PM, van Drongelen M, Te Morsche RH, Peters WH, Steegers-Theunissen RP: Orofacial clefts and spina bifida: N-acetyltransferase phenotype, maternal smoking, and medication use. Teratology. 2002 Nov;66(5):260-6. BACKGROUND: Orofacial clefts and spina bifida are midline defects with a multifactorial etiology. Maternal smoking and medication use periconceptionally have been studied as risk factors for these malformations. The biotransformation enzyme N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2), plays a part in the inactivation of toxic compounds in cigarette smoke and medication. We investigated maternal NAT2 phenotype and the interaction with smoking and medication use periconceptionally on orofacial cleft and spina bifida risk in offspring. METHODS: In this case-control study of 45 mothers of orofacial cleft children, 39 mothers of spina bifida children and 73 control mothers, NAT2 acetylator status was determined by measuring urinary caffeine metabolites. RESULTS: Slow NAT2 acetylators showed no increased risk for orofacial cleft (OR = 1.0, 95% CI: 0.4-2.3) or spina bifida offspring (OR = 0.7, 95% CI: 0.3-1.7) compared to fast NAT2 acetylators. More mothers with orofacial cleft and spina bifida offspring smoked cigarettes (36% and 23% respectively) and used medication periconceptionally (38% and 44% respectively) compared to control mothers (smoking:18%, medication use:19%). No interaction between maternal NAT2 acetylator status and smoking or medication use was observed for orofacial cleft and spina bifida risk. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal smoking and medication use is associated with orofacial cleft risk as well as medication use is with spina bifida. The maternal NAT2 acetylator status, however, was not associated with an increased risk for orofacial cleft or spina bifida offspring, nor in combination with periconceptional smoking or medication use.

Synpolydactyly	HOXD8	Positive	PMID:7581388	Sarfarazi M, Akarsu AN, Sayli BS: Localization of the syndactyly type II (synpolydactyly) locus to 2q31 region and identification of tight linkage to HOXD8 intragenic marker. Hum Mol Genet. 1995 Aug;4(8):1453-8. Syndactyly type II (SynPolyDactyly; SPD) is an autosomal dominant condition with incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity. Sixty-two meioses from a kindred with 425 individuals were used to map the SPD locus to 2q31 region, approximately 1.7 cM (Lod score = 12.96) centromeric to HOXD8 intragenic marker. Other homeobox-containing genes in this region have previously been ordered as cen-DLX1/DLX2-EVX2-(5' --> HOXD13..HOXD8.HOXD1 --> 3')-tel')-tel. A single recombinant with HOXD8 excluded the most 3' end of HOXD cluster as a candidate site for SPD, but a mutation in the 5' end of HOXD cluster, especially in HOXD13, EVX2 or DLX2/DLX1, may still be responsible for this phenotype. An updated order of D2S142-D2S111-(D2S335/D2S333)-D2S326-D2 S1238-SPD- (HOXD8/D2S1244)-(D2S300/D2S138)-D2S148- D2S324- D2S1384-D2S434 [sequence:see text] was deduced from meiotic recombination events.

Am J Hum Genet. 2007 Feb;80(2):361-71. Epub 2007 Jan 3. HOXD13, the homeobox-containing gene located at the most 5' end of the HOXD cluster, plays a critical role in limb development. It has been shown that mutations in human HOXD13 can give rise to limb malformations, with variable expressivity and a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations. Polyalanine expansions in HOXD13 cause synpolydactyly, whereas amino acid substitutions in the homeodomain are associated with brachydactyly types D and E. We describe two large Han Chinese families with different limb malformations, one with syndactyly type V and the other with limb features overlapping brachydactyly types A4, D, and E and mild syndactyly of toes 2 and 3. Two-point linkage analysis showed LOD scores > 3 (theta =0) for markers within and/or flanking the HOXD13 locus in both families. In the family with syndactyly type V, we identified a missense mutation in the HOXD13 homeodomain, c.950A--> G (p.Q317R), which leads to substitution of the highly conserved glutamine that is important for DNA-binding specificity and affinity. In the family with complex brachydactyly and syndactyly, we detected a deletion of 21 bp in the imperfect GCN (where N denotes A, C, G, or T) triplet-containing exon 1 of HOXD13, which results in a polyalanine contraction of seven residues. Moreover, we found that the mutant HOXD13 with the p.Q317R substitution was unable to transactivate the human EPHA7 promoter. Molecular modeling data supported these experimental results. The calculated interactions energies were in agreement with the measured changes of the activity. Our data established the link between HOXD13 and two additional limb phenotypes--syndactyly type V and brachydactyly type A4--and demonstrated that a polyalanine contraction in HOXD13, most likely, led to other digital anomalies but not to synpolydactyly. We suggest the term "HOXD13 limb morphopathies" for the spectrum of limb disorders caused by HOXD13 mutations.

Clin Genet. 2006 Jun;69(6):518-24. Syndactyly type II or synpolydactyly (SPD) is the second most frequent syndactyly type and is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. The cardinal features of this malformation are the cutaneous or bony fusion of third and fourth fingers, and fourth and fifth toes associated with additional digital elements within the web. It shows incomplete penetrance and high inter- and intrafamilial phenotypic variability. Two loci are known for SPD (MIM 186000, MIM 608180) associated with mutations in HOXD13 and FBLN1, respectively. Here, we report further genetic heterogeneity for SDP. Employing a whole genomic screen, we demonstrate, in a large Pakistani kindred, that the classical phenotype of SPD maps on a new locus at chromosome 14q11.2-q12. The highest LOD score (Z (max) = 4.06) was obtained with microsatellite marker D14S264, and the multipoint LOD score reached a maximum of 5.01. Haplotype analysis revealed that the disease interval is flanked by microsatellite markers D14S283 and D14S1060, encompassing a physical distance of 10.72 Mb. We propose to allocate to this locus the symbol SPD3 (synpolydactyly 3), and to name the loci associated with HOXD13 or FBLN1 mutations SPD1 and SPD2, respectively.

Zhonghua Yi Xue Yi Chuan Xue Za Zhi. 2005 Jun;22(3):277-80. OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical features and to identify homeobox D13 (HOXD13) gene mutation of the affected individuals in a Chinese synpolydactyly (SPD) kindred. METHODS: Clinical data and peripheral blood samples of SPD family members were obtained through field investigation. For every member of this pedigreeithe fragment containing mutational hot spots of HOXD13 was amplified by PCR for mutation screening. To examine whether there is any other mutation within coding sequence of HOXD13, exon 1 and exon 2 of HOXD13 were also amplified by PCR. All the amplified fragments were electrophoresed on 2% agarose gels and then the mutant fragments were electrophoresed on 5% polyacrylamide gels to be separated. Purified PCR products of normal and selected mutant alleles were directly sequenced. RESULTS: Comparing the HOXD13 coding sequence of the affected individuals with HOXD13 sequence in the GenBank and with that of the unaffected, an inserted segment coding 8 alanine residues within HOXD13 was found segregating with the disorder. This mutation is also termed polyalanine expansion. The 8-alanine expansion can be interpreted as a reduplication of normal alanines 5-12. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that synpolydactyly in this kindred may be caused by polyalanine expansion in HOXD13.

Hum Mol Genet. 2004 Oct 15;13(20):2351-9. Epub 2004 Aug 27. Poly-alanine (Ala) tract expansions in transcription factors have been shown to be associated with human birth defects such as malformations of the brain, the digits, and other structures. Expansions of a poly-Ala tract from 15 to 22 (+7)-29 (+14) Ala in Hoxd13, for example, result in the limb malformation synpolydactyly in humans and in mice [synpolydactyly homolog (spdh)]. Here, we show that an increase of the Ala repeat above a certain length (22 Ala) is associated with a shift in the localization of Hoxd13 from nuclear to cytoplasmic, where it forms large amorphous aggregates. We observed similar aggregates for expansion mutations in SOX3, RUNX2 and HOXA13, pointing to a common mechanism. Cytoplasmic aggregation of mutant Hoxd13 protein is influenced by the length of the repeat, the level of expression and the efficacy of degradation by the proteasome. Heat shock proteins Hsp70 and Hsp40 co-localize with the aggregates and activation of the chaperone system by geldanamycin leads to a reduction of aggregate formation. Furthermore, recombinant mutant Hoxd13 protein forms aggregates in vitro demonstrating spontaneous misfolding of the protein. We analyzed the mouse mutant spdh, which harbors a +7 Ala expansion in Hoxd13 similar to the human synpolydactyly mutations, as an in vivo model and were able to show a reduction of mutant Hoxd13 and, in contrast to wt Hoxd13, a primarily cytoplasmic localization of the protein. Our results provide evidence that poly-Ala repeat expansions in transcription factors result in misfolding, degradation and cytoplasmic aggregation of the mutant proteins.
Synpolydactyly	HOXD13	Positive	PMID:14669516	Qin W, Shu AL, Xing QH, Yang MS, Feng GY, He L: [Genetic analysis of a Chinese pedigree with congenital synpolydactyly] . Yi Chuan Xue Bao. 2003 Oct;30(10):973-7. Syndactyly is a limb malformation that shows a characteristic manifestation in both hands and feet. This condition is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait with reduced penetrance. Clinical presentation, in general, is complete or partial webbing between 3rd and 4th fingers. Syndactyly type I, II and III were mapped to 2q34-36, 2q31-q32 and 6q21-23.2 respectively. Syndactyly type II is named as synpolydactyly (SPD). Expansion of a polyalanine tract in the HOXD13 gene is known to cause synpolydactyly. HOXD13 gene locates in the HoxD complex. Nine homologous genes (HOXD1, -D3, -D4, -D8, -D9, -D10, -D11, -D12, -D13) of HoxD complex locate on chromosome 2 in the order of HOXD1 to HOXD13, among which HOXD13 is closest to the centromere. Deletions and duplications in HoxD complex or its upstream regulator factors have been identified to cause hand heteroplasia and consequently lead to abnormity of finger number or abnormity of configuration. We performed linkage analysis in a kindred with autosomal dominant hereditary syndactyly. Tight linkage to markers on chromosome 2q31-q32 (maximum two-point lod score: 6.78 at recombination fraction theta = 0.00) was observed. Multipoint linkage analysis produced a maximum LOD score of 7.02. Haplotype construction and analysis of recombination events narrowed this locus to a 20.61 cM region between markers D2S2302 and D2S315. No mutation was found in the coding region, the intro-exon boundaries, or part of the promoter region of HOXD13. Our result demonstrates that synpolydactyly locus in the Chinese Han Population is in the region of chromosome 2q31-q32 but a different causal gene can be involved.
Synpolydactyly	HOXD13	Positive	PMID:12900906	Kan SH, Johnson D, Giele H, Wilkie AO: An acceptor splice site mutation in HOXD13 results in variable hand, but consistent foot malformations. Am J Med Genet A. 2003 Aug 15;121(1):69-74. HOXD13 is the most 5' of the HOXD cluster of homeobox genes in chromosome band 2q31.1. Heterozygous expansions of a polyalanine tract in HOXD13 are typically associated with synpolydactyly characterized by insertional digit duplication associated with syndactyly. We screened for mutations of HOXD13 in patients with a variety of limb malformations and identified a novel heterozygous mutation (758-2delA) in a three-generation family without the typical synpolydactyly phenotype in the hands, but with bilateral partial duplication of the 2nd metatarsals within the first web space of the feet. This mutation locates in the acceptor splice site of exon 2 and is predicted to cause failure of normal splicing of HOXD13. The foot abnormality in this family is similar to that described in two families by Goodman et al. [1998: Am. J. Hum. Genet. 63: 992-1000] in which different deletions of HOXD13 were reported. These findings together lend support to a distinct phenotype resulting from haploinsufficiency of HOXD13.
Synpolydactyly	HOXD13	Positive	PMID:12620993	Caronia G, Goodman FR, McKeown CM, Scambler PJ, Zappavigna V: An I47L substitution in the HOXD13 homeodomain causes a novel human limb malformation by producing a selective loss of function. Development. 2003 Apr;130(8):1701-12. The 5' members of the Hoxa and Hoxd gene clusters play major roles in vertebrate limb development. One such gene, HOXD13, is mutated in the human limb malformation syndrome synpolydactyly. Both polyalanine tract expansions and frameshifting deletions in HOXD13 cause similar forms of this condition, but it remains unclear whether other kinds of HOXD13 mutations could produce different phenotypes. We describe a six-generation family in which a novel combination of brachydactyly and central polydactyly co-segregates with a missense mutation that substitutes leucine for isoleucine at position 47 of the HOXD13 homeodomain. We compared the HOXD13 (I47L) mutant protein both in vitro and in vivo to the wild-type protein and to an artificial HOXD13 mutant, HOXD13 (IQN), which is completely unable to bind DNA. We found that the mutation causes neither a dominant-negative effect nor a gain of function, but instead impairs DNA binding at some sites bound by wild-type HOXD13. Using retrovirus-mediated misexpression in developing chick limbs, we showed that wild-type HOXD13 could upregulate chick EphA7 in the autopod, but that HOXD13 (I47L) could not. In the zeugopod, however, HOXD13 (I47L) produced striking changes in tibial morphology and ectopic cartilages, which were never produced by HOXD13 (IQN), consistent with a selective rather than generalised loss of function. Thus, a mutant HOX protein that recognises only a subset of sites recognised by the wild-type protein causes a novel human malformation, pointing to a hitherto undescribed mechanism by which missense mutations in transcription factors can generate unexpected phenotypes. Intriguingly, both HOXD13 (I47L) and HOXD13 (IQN) produced more severe shortening in proximal limb regions than did wild-type HOXD13, suggesting that functional suppression of anterior Hox genes by more posterior ones does not require DNA binding and is mediated by protein:protein interactions.
Synpolydactyly	HOXD13	Positive	PMID:12357469	Goodman FR: Limb malformations and the human HOX genes. Am J Med Genet. 2002 Oct 15;112(3):256-65. HOX genes encode a family of transcription factors of fundamental importance for body patterning during embryonic development. Humans, like most vertebrates, have 39 HOX genes organized into four clusters, with major roles in the development of the central nervous system, axial skeleton, gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts, external genitalia, and limbs. The first two limb malformations shown to be caused by mutations in the human HOX genes were synpolydactyly and hand-foot-genital syndrome, which result from mutations in HOXD13 and HOXA13, respectively. This review describes a variety of limb malformations now known to be caused by specific different mutations in these two genes, including polyalanine tract expansions, nonsense mutations, and missense mutations, many with phenotypic consequences that could not have been predicted from previous knowledge of mouse models or HOX protein function. Limb malformations may also result from chromosomal deletions involving the HOXD and HOXA clusters, and from regulatory mutations affecting single or multiple HOX genes.
Synpolydactyly	HOXD13	Positive	PMID:12116248	Kjaer KW, Hedeboe J, Bugge M, Hansen C, Friis-Henriksen K, Vestergaard MB, Tommerup N, Opitz JM: HOXD13 polyalanine tract expansion in classical synpolydactyly type Vordingborg. Am J Med Genet. 2002 Jun 15;110(2):116-21. In 1927, Oluf Thomsen, in a classic paper, described a seven-generation family with autosomal dominant axial synpolydactyly (SPD)--the Vordingborgtyp of axis duplication and dysostosis. Expansion of a polyalanine tract in the HOXD13 gene is known to cause synpolydactyly. We have rediscovered part of the family described by Thomsen, and detected a 9 triplet polyalanine expansion within HOXD13segregating with the disorder. The phenotypic spectrum in mutation carriers ranged from severe to inapparent bone malformations. In the latter case, only dermatoglyphics revealed the genetic status.
Synpolydactyly	HOXD13	Positive	PMID:12073020	Utsch B, Becker K, Brock D, Lentze MJ, Bidlingmaier F, Ludwig M: A novel stable polyalanine [poly (A)] expansion in the HOXA13 gene associated with hand-foot-genital syndrome: proper function of poly (A)-harbouring transcription factors depends on a critical repeat length?. Hum Genet. 2002 May;110(5):488-94. Epub 2002 Apr 4. Hand-foot-genital syndrome (HFGS) is a dominantly inherited congenital malformation affecting the distal limbs and genitourinary tract. Here, we describe the phenotype and its molecular basis in a family that presented with HFGS. Genetic analysis revealed that the condition is caused by an 18-bp in-frame duplication within a cryptic trinucleotide repeat sequence encoding an 18-residue polyalanine tract in the homeoboxgene ( HOX) A13. This mutation expands the stretch with six extra alanine residues. Similar types of mutation (plus eight alanines) have recently been found in another HFGS family and also in the human HOXD13 gene (plus seven up to plus 14 residues) where it leads to synpolydactyly (SPD), a further congenital limb malformation rarely associated with genital abnormalities. As observed in our family, all the expanded tracts encoding polyalanine, either reported for HOXA13 or HOXD13, are quite stable when transmitted within affected families. Unlike disorders with unstable expansions of perfect trinucleotide repeats the molecular mechanism underlying these polyalanine expansions should be unequal crossing-over rather than replication slippage. The alanine tract elongation may prevent protein-protein interactions of the mutant HOXA13, thereby inducing a localized heterochrony in the sequence of distal limb and genitourinary development.
Synpolydactyly	fibulin-1	Positive	PMID:16712704	Malik S, Abbasi AA, Ansar M, Ahmad W, Koch MC, Grzeschik KH: Genetic heterogeneity of synpolydactyly: a novel locus SPD3 maps to chromosome 14q11.2-q12. Clin Genet. 2006 Jun;69(6):518-24. Syndactyly type II or synpolydactyly (SPD) is the second most frequent syndactyly type and is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. The cardinal features of this malformation are the cutaneous or bony fusion of third and fourth fingers, and fourth and fifth toes associated with additional digital elements within the web. It shows incomplete penetrance and high inter- and intrafamilial phenotypic variability. Two loci are known for SPD (MIM 186000, MIM 608180) associated with mutations in HOXD13 and FBLN1, respectively. Here, we report further genetic heterogeneity for SDP. Employing a whole genomic screen, we demonstrate, in a large Pakistani kindred, that the classical phenotype of SPD maps on a new locus at chromosome 14q11.2-q12. The highest LOD score (Z (max) = 4.06) was obtained with microsatellite marker D14S264, and the multipoint LOD score reached a maximum of 5.01. Haplotype analysis revealed that the disease interval is flanked by microsatellite markers D14S283 and D14S1060, encompassing a physical distance of 10.72 Mb. We propose to allocate to this locus the symbol SPD3 (synpolydactyly 3), and to name the loci associated with HOXD13 or FBLN1 mutations SPD1 and SPD2, respectively.
Synpolydactyly	fibulin-1	Positive	PMID:11836357	Debeer P, Schoenmakers EF, Twal WO, Argraves WS, De Smet L, Fryns JP, Van De Ven WJ: The fibulin-1 gene (FBLN1) is disrupted in a t (12;22) associated with a complex type of synpolydactyly. J Med Genet. 2002 Feb;39(2):98-104. Molecular analysis of the reciprocal chromosomal translocation t (12;22)(p11.2;q13.3) cosegregating with a complex type of synpolydactyly showed involvement of an alternatively spliced exon of the fibulin-1 gene (FBLN1 located in 22q13.3) and the C12orf2 (HoJ-1) gene on the short arm of chromosome 12. Investigation of the possible functional involvement of the fibulin-1 protein (FBLN1) in the observed phenotype showed that FBLN1 is expressed in the extracellular matrix (ECM) in association with the digits in the developing limb. Furthermore, fibroblasts derived from patients with the complex type of synpolydactyly displayed alterations in the level of FBLN1-D splice variant incorporated into the ECM and secreted into the conditioned culture medium. By contrast, the expression of the FBLN1-C splice variant was not perturbed in the patient fibroblasts. Based on these findings, we propose that the t (12;22) results in haploinsufficiency of the FBLN1-D variant, which could lead to the observed limb malformations.
Synpolydactyly	HOXD9	Positive	PMID:11778160	Goodman FR, Majewski F, Collins AL, Scambler PJ: A 117-kb microdeletion removing HOXD9-HOXD13 and EVX2 causes synpolydactyly. Am J Hum Genet. 2002 Feb;70(2):547-55. Epub 2002 Jan 3. Studies in mouse and chick have shown that the 5' HoxD genes play major roles in the development of the limbs and genitalia. In humans, mutations in HOXD13 cause the dominantly inherited limb malformation synpolydactyly (SPD). Haploinsufficiency for the 5' HOXD genes has recently been proposed to underlie the monodactyly and penoscrotal hypoplasia in two children with chromosomal deletions encompassing the entire HOXD cluster. Similar deletions, however, have previously been associated with split-hand/foot malformation (SHFM), including monodactyly. Here we report a father and daughter with SPD who carry a 117-kb microdeletion at the 5' end of the HOXD cluster. By sequencing directly across the deletion breakpoint, we show that this microdeletion removes only HOXD9-HOXD13 and EVX2. We also report a girl with bilateral split foot and a chromosomal deletion that includes the entire HOXD cluster and extends approximately 5 Mb centromeric to it. Our findings indicate that haploinsufficiency for the 5' HOXD genes causes not SHFM but SPD and point to the presence of a novel locus for SHFM in the interval between EVX2 and D2S294. They also suggest that there is a regulatory region, upstream of the HOXD cluster, that is responsible for activating the cluster as a whole.

Synpolydactyly	HOXA13	Negative	PMID:15643670	Grier DG, Thompson A, Kwasniewska A, McGonigle GJ, Halliday HL, Lappin TR: The pathophysiology of HOX genes and their role in cancer. J Pathol. 2005 Jan;205(2):154-71. The HOM-C clustered prototype homeobox genes of Drosophila, and their counterparts, the HOX genes in humans, are highly conserved at the genomic level. These master regulators of development continue to be expressed throughout adulthood in various tissues and organs. The physiological and patho-physiological functions of this network of genes are being avidly pursued within the scientific community, but defined roles for them remain elusive. The order of expression of HOX genes within a cluster is co-ordinated during development, so that the 3' genes are expressed more anteriorly and earlier than the 5' genes. Mutations in HOXA13 and HOXD13 are associated with disorders of limb formation such as hand-foot-genital syndrome (HFGS), synpolydactyly (SPD), and brachydactyly. Haematopoietic progenitors express HOX genes in a pattern characteristic of the lineage and stage of differentiation of the cells. In leukaemia, dysregulated HOX gene expression can occur due to chromosomal translocations involving upstream regulators such as the MLL gene, or the fusion of a HOX gene to another gene such as the nucleoporin, NUP98. Recent investigations of HOX gene expression in leukaemia are providing important insights into disease classification and prediction of clinical outcome. Whereas the oncogenic potential of certain HOX genes in leukaemia has already been defined, their role in other neoplasms is currently being studied. Progress has been hampered by the experimental approach used in many studies in which the expression of small subsets of HOX genes was analysed, and complicated by the functional redundancy implicit in the HOX gene system. Attempts to elucidate the function of HOX genes in malignant transformation will be enhanced by a better understanding of their upstream regulators and downstream target genes.
Synpolydactyly	HOXA13	Negative	PMID:12357469	Goodman FR: Limb malformations and the human HOX genes. Am J Med Genet. 2002 Oct 15;112(3):256-65. HOX genes encode a family of transcription factors of fundamental importance for body patterning during embryonic development. Humans, like most vertebrates, have 39 HOX genes organized into four clusters, with major roles in the development of the central nervous system, axial skeleton, gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts, external genitalia, and limbs. The first two limb malformations shown to be caused by mutations in the human HOX genes were synpolydactyly and hand-foot-genital syndrome, which result from mutations in HOXD13 and HOXA13, respectively. This review describes a variety of limb malformations now known to be caused by specific different mutations in these two genes, including polyalanine tract expansions, nonsense mutations, and missense mutations, many with phenotypic consequences that could not have been predicted from previous knowledge of mouse models or HOX protein function. Limb malformations may also result from chromosomal deletions involving the HOXD and HOXA clusters, and from regulatory mutations affecting single or multiple HOX genes.
Synpolydactyly	HOXA13	Negative	PMID:11206481	Goodman FR, Scambler PJ: Human HOX gene mutations. Clin Genet. 2001 Jan;59(1):1-11. HOX genes play a fundamental role in the development of the vertebrate central nervous system, axial skeleton, limbs, gut, urogenital tract and external genitalia, but it is only in the last 4 years that mutations in two of the 39 human HOX genes have been shown to cause congenital malformations; HOXD13, which is mutated in synpolydactyly, and HOXA13, which is mutated in Hand-Foot-Genital syndrome. Here we review the mutations already identified in these two genes, consider how these mutations may act, and discuss the possibility that further mutations remain to be discovered both in developmental disorders and in cancer.
Synpolydactyly	HOXA13	Negative	PMID:10364522	Del Campo M, Jones MC, Veraksa AN, Curry CJ, Jones KL, Mascarello JT, Ali-Kahn-Catts Z, Drumheller T, McGinnis W: Monodactylous limbs and abnormal genitalia are associated with hemizygosity for the human 2q31 region that includes the HOXD cluster. Am J Hum Genet. 1999 Jul;65(1):104-10. Vertebrates have four clusters of Hox genes (HoxA, HoxB, HoxC, and HoxD). A variety of expression and mutation studies indicate that posterior members of the HoxA and HoxD clusters play an important role in vertebrate limb development. In humans, mutations in HOXD13 have been associated with type II syndactyly or synpolydactyly, and, in HOXA13, with hand-foot-genital syndrome. We have investigated two unrelated children with a previously unreported pattern of severe developmental defects on the anterior-posterior (a-p) limb axis and in the genitalia, consisting of a single bone in the zeugopod, either monodactyly or oligodactyly in the autopod of all four limbs, and penoscrotal hypoplasia. Both children are heterozygous for a deletion that eliminates at least eight (HOXD3-HOXD13) of the nine genes in the HOXD cluster. We propose that the patients' phenotypes are due in part to haploinsufficiency for HOXD-cluster genes. This hypothesis is supported by the expression patterns of these genes in early vertebrate embryos. However, the involvement of additional genes in the region could explain the discordance, in severity, between these human phenotypes and the milder, non-polarized phenotypes present in mice hemizygous for HoxD cluster genes. These cases represent the first reported examples of deficiencies for an entire Hox cluster in vertebrates and suggest that the diploid dose of human HOXD genes is crucial for normal growth and patterning of the limbs along the anterior-posterior axis.
Synpolydactyly	DAD-R	Positive	PMID:10812081	Kuittinen T, Eggert A, Lindholm P, Horelli-Kuitunen N, Palotie A, Maris JM, Saarma M: A novel human processed gene, DAD-R, maps to 12p12 and is expressed in several organs. FEBS Lett. 2000 May 12;473(2):233-6. A cDNA of a processed gene of human DAD-1 (defender against apoptotic cell death) was cloned from the human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y. The genomic sequence of this novel processed gene, DAD-R, lacked introns and was flanked by 8 bp terminal repeats. RT-PCR showed that the transcript is expressed predominantly in testis, ovaries, pancreas, lung and skeletal muscle. DAD-R has several possible initiation codons, one of them producing an open reading frame comprising 75% of the DAD-1 gene. We determined the chromosomal localization of DAD-R as 12p11.2-12p12.1, an area linked to familial synpolydactyly and frequently amplified in a variety of cancers, including those of testis, ovaries, pancreas and lungs.
Synpolydactyly	homeobox	Positive	PMID:16497573	Horsnell K, Ali M, Malik S, Wilson L, Hall C, Debeer P, Crow Y: Clinical phenotype associated with homozygosity for a HOXD13 7-residue polyalanine tract expansion. Eur J Med Genet. 2006 Sep-Oct;49(5):396-401. Epub 2006 Feb 9. Synpolydactyly (SPD) is an autosomal dominant malformation of the distal limbs caused by mutations in the homeobox gene HOXD13 located on chromosome 2q31. We detail the clinical findings in a consanguineous Pakistani family segregating a HOXD13 7-residue polyalanine tract expansion. Three members of this pedigree were heterozygotes with features typical of SPD. Two further members demonstrate a more severe phenotype consistent with homozygosity for the familial mutation. We also report a child from a consanguineous Somali family homozygous for the same molecular lesion. Characteristic changes include a complex central polydactyly in the hands, abnormal modelling of the metacarpals and metatarsals, an increased number of carpal bones with abnormal shapes, hypoplasia or absence of the fifth digital rays in the feet, hypoplasia of the middle phalanges and abnormally long proximal phalanges in hands and feet. These cases illustrate the distinct phenotype associated with homozygosity for a HOXD13 mutation and also highlight the importance of considering homozygosity for a dominant mutation in consanguineous pedigrees.

Vitelliform_macular_dystrophy	PYGM	Negative	PMID:8064817	Weber BH, Walker D, Muller B: Molecular evidence for non-penetrance in Best's disease. J Med Genet. 1994 May;31(5):388-92. The present study provides evidence for a possible case of non-penetrance in Best's disease. We have analysed the at risk members of a three generation family with an established history of Best's disease by ophthalmoscopic examination, electrophysiological tests, and genetic analysis. The clinical examination identified 10 affected and five unaffected persons in this family. Genetic linkage analysis strongly supports linkage of the disease locus to DNA microsatellite markers from proximal 11q. The genotyping data were used to construct the familial haplotype associated with Best's disease. One person was identified who has inherited the Best's disease haplotype from his affected mother. Fundus examination and electrophysiological tests have repeatedly been performed in this patient but failed to show any signs of the disease. Based on these findings we have jointly estimated the most likely order of the Best's disease locus relative to the closet flanking markers at various penetrance values. A maximum likelihood estimate for the heterozygote penetrance was reached for the locus order D11S903-Best's disease-PYGM at a penetrance value of 0.96.
Vitelliform_macular_dystrophy	PYGM	Negative	PMID:8020974	Weber BH, Walker D, Muller B, Mar L: Best's vitelliform dystrophy (VMD2) maps between D11S903 and PYGM: no evidence for locus heterogeneity. Genomics. 1994 Mar 15;20(2):267-74. Vitelliform macular dystrophy, also known as Best's disease (BD), is an autosomal dominant disorder typically characterized by an accumulation of yellowish material in the macular area. The disease is slowly progressive and eventually results in atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptor cells, thus severely impairing central vision. The biochemical defect underlying this condition is unknown. More recently, the BD locus (VMD2) was mapped to chromosome 11 by genetic linkage to microsatellite markers at D11S871 and INT2. In the present study, we report a detailed genetic analysis in three multigeneration Best's disease families using eight microsatellite markers spanning approximately 26 cM around the putative BD locus. We demonstrate linkage between Best's disease and the markers used. Furthermore, haplotype analysis in our unrelated Best's disease families identified three distinct haplotypes associated with the disease, strongly suggesting independent origins of the BD mutation. Finally, we characterized two recombinant BD chromosomes that significantly refine the location of the disease gene to a 3.7-cM interval between markers at D11S903 and PYGM. PCR-hybrid mapping sublocalized this interval to the pericentromeric region of chromosome 11.
Vitelliform_macular_dystrophy	flap-endonuclease-1	Negative	PMID:10769175	Leonard AE, Kelder B, Bobik EG, Chuang LT, Parker-Barnes JM, Thurmond JM, Kroeger PE, Kopchick JJ, Huang YS, Mukerji P: cDNA cloning and characterization of human Delta5-desaturase involved in the biosynthesis of arachidonic acid. Biochem J. 2000 May 1;347 Pt 3:719-24. Two human expressed sequence tag (EST) cDNA sequences with identity with Delta (5)- and Delta (6)-desaturases from a filamentous fungus, Mortierella alpina, were identified from the LifeSeq (R) database of Incyte Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Palo Alto, CA, U.S.A.). An oligonucleotide complementary to the 3' EST cDNA sequences was used to screen human liver cDNA using rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE)-PCR. The amplified DNA fragment had 98% identity with a putative open reading frame (ORF) predicted from a human genomic sequence, and encoded 444 amino acids. Expression of this ORF in mouse fibroblast cells demonstrated that the encoded protein was a Delta (5)-desaturase, as determined by the conversion of dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (C (20:3,n-6)) into arachidonic acid (C (20:4,n-6)). The human Delta (5)-desaturase contained a predicted N-terminal cytochrome b (5)-like domain, as well as three histidine-rich domains. A tissue expression profile revealed that this gene is highly expressed in fetal liver, fetal brain, adult brain and adrenal gland. A search of the existing databases led to localization of this ORF within a 14 kb interval flanked by the flap endonuclease-1 (FEN1) and vitelliform macular dystrophy (Best's disease; VMD2) loci of chromosome 11q12.
Vitelliform_macular_dystrophy	ABC1	Negative	PMID:17491602	Patel N, Adewoyin T, Chong NV: Age-related macular degeneration: a perspective on genetic studies. Eye. 2007 May 11;. AimAge-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a common macular disease in the developed world and recent studies have shown that specific genes may be associated with it and may contribute to a higher risk of developing AMD.ObjectiveOur objective was to review systematically recent publications related to the genetics of AMD and provide relevant information that would help both scientists and clinicians in advising patients.MethodA systematic search was performed on PubMed, Medline, and National Library of Medicine as well as ARVO abstracts using key words relevant to the genetic associations of AMD.ResultsThe most important genetic associations in AMD involved the complement factor H (CFH) gene, which showed that possession of the variant Y402H polymorphism significantly increases the risk for AMD. Protective genes have also been identified such as those on either factor B (BFor complement factor B (CFB)) or complement component 2 (C2) genes. The genes involved in inherited macular dystrophies such as ATP-binding cassette, subfamily A (ABC1), member 4 (ABCA4), vitelliform macular dystrophy (VMD2), tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-3 (TIMP3), and EFEMP1have yielded some important information but further confirmatory work has yet to establish a clear association with AMD.ConclusionPatients with AMD possess specific genetic variants of the CFHgene, which put them at a higher risk of developing the disease. Other unaffected individuals may possess certain protective genetic variants, which could prevent them from developing AMD. Further research will no doubt shed light on other such mechanisms and these will be useful in identifying possible direct targets for drugs or indirectly through modulation of the genes responsible for disease presentation.Eye advance online publication, 11 May 2007; doi:10.1038/sj.eye.6702844.
Vitelliform_macular_dystrophy	DCMD	Negative	PMID:8905850	Pinckers A, Cuypers MH, Aandekerk AL: The EOG in Best's disease and dominant cystoid macular dystrophy (DCMD). . Ophthalmic Genet. 1996 Sep;17(3):103-8. The electro-oculogram (EOG) was studied in 156 normal patients, 103 patients with Best's disease, and 52 patients with dominant cystoid macular dystrophy (DCMD). Statistical analysis was performed by comparing the distribution of Lp/Dt ratios of the groups. Strength of association between Lp/Dt ratio and age was studied with correlation and regression analysis. In normal patients and in those with Best's disease, there was no significant correlation between age and Lp/Dt ratio. Obviously, the gene defect in Best's disease causes an altered light-sensitive slow oscillation that remains stable throughout life. In DCMD patients, there was a significant negative correlation between age and Lp/Dt ratio for the total sample and for the female subgroup. Likely, the gene defect in DCMD interferes with capillary permeability, that becomes susceptible to changes of the female hormones.
Vitelliform_macular_dystrophy	DDB1	Negative	PMID:9781049	Stohr H, Marquardt A, Rivera A, Kellner U, Weber BH: Refined mapping of the gene encoding the p127 kDa UV-damaged DNA-binding protein (DDB1) within 11q12-q13.1 and its exclusion in Best's vitelliform macular dystrophy. Eur J Hum Genet. 1998 Jul-Aug;6(4):400-5. Best's vitelliform macular dystrophy (Best's disease) is an autosomal dominant disorder of unknown causes and is typically characterised by an accumulation of lipofuscin-like material in the subretinal space of the macula. The disease gene has been localised to chromosome 11q12-13.1 within a 1.4 Mbp interval flanked by markers at D11S1765 and uteroglobin (UGB). Here we report the refined mapping of the gene encoding the p127 kDa subunit (DDB1) of a UV damage-specific DNA binding protein within the D11S1765-UGB region. Northern blot analysis demonstrates an abundant expression of the DDB1 transcript in the retina suggesting a functional role for DDB1 in this tissue. These considerations together with the chromosomal localisation have led us to evaluate the possible involvement of DDB1 in the pathogenesis of Best's disease.
Vitelliform_macular_dystrophy	CACD	Negative	PMID:9152224	Felbor U, Doepner D, Schneider U, Zrenner E, Weber BH: Evaluation of the gene encoding the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-3 in various maculopathies. Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci. 1997 May;38(6):1054-9. PURPOSE: Mutations in the gene encoding the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-3 (TIMP3) have been shown previously to cause Sorsby's fundus dystrophy, an autosomal-dominant disorder characterized by extracellular matrix irregularities in Bruch's membrane. To assess the involvement of TIMP3 in a variety of other macular dystrophies, the authors have screened this gene for disease-causing mutations in age-related macular degeneration (AMD), adult vitelliform macular dystrophy (AVMD), central areolar choroidal dystrophy (CACD), syndrome-associated macular dystrophies, cone-rod dystrophy, and a group with unspecified macular degeneration. METHODS: Single-stranded conformational analysis of the entire coding region was performed using the polymerase chain reaction and oligonucleotide primers flanking the five exons of the TIMP3 gene as well as the putative promotor region and a highly conserved fragment of the 3'-untranslated region. The authors analyzed a total of 217 patients, including 143 patients with AMD, 28 patients with AVMD, 21 patients with CACD, and 25 patients with other forms of macular dystrophy. RESULTS: In the 217 patients analyzed, the authors have identified one sequence alteration (a G-to-C base change) in the 5'-untranslated region in a patient with AMD. However, the functional consequences of this mutation are not clear. No other disease-causing mutations were found. The authors have characterized a frequent intragenic polymorphism in exon 3 of the TIMP3 gene (heterozygosity = 0.57) that will be useful for genetic linkage or allele sharing analyses or both. CONCLUSIONS: The authors' results suggest that TIMP3 is not a major factor in the cause of AMD, AVMD, and CACD. Thus far, Sorsby's fundus dystrophy appears to be the only phenotype known to be associated with mutations in TIMP3.
Vitelliform_macular_dystrophy	glutamate-pyruvate-transaminase	Positive	PMID:9119391	Sohocki MM, Sullivan LS, Harrison WR, Sodergren EJ, Elder FF, Weinstock G, Tanase S, Daiger SP: Human glutamate pyruvate transaminase (GPT): localization to 8q24.3, cDNA and genomic sequences, and polymorphic sites. Genomics. 1997 Mar 1;40(2):247-52. Two frequent protein variants of glutamate pyruvate transminase (GPT) (E.C.2.6.1.2) have been used as genetic markers in humans for more than two decades, although chromosomal mapping of the GPT locus in the 1980s produced conflicting results. To resolve this conflict and develop useful DNA markers for this gene, we isolated and characterized cDNA and genomic clones of GPT. We have definitively mapped human GPT to the terminus of 8q using several methods. First, two cosmids shown to contain the GPT sequence were derived from a chromosome 8-specific library. Second, by fluorescence in situ hybridization, we mapped the cosmid containing the human GPT gene to chromosome band 8q24.3. Third, we mapped the rat gpt cDNA to the syntenic region of rat chromosome 7. Finally, PCR primers specific to human GPT amplify sequences contained within a "half-YAC" from the long arm of chromosome 8, that is, a YAC containing the 8q telomere. The human GPT genomic sequence spans 2,7 kb and consists of 11 exons, ranging in size from 79 to 243 bp. The exonic sequence encodes a protein of 495 amino acids that is nearly identical to the previously reported protein sequence of human GPT-1. The two polymorphic GPT isozymes are the results of a nucleotide substitution in codon 14, coding for a histidine in GPT-1 and an asparagine in GPT-2, which causes a gain or loss of an NlaIII restriction site. In addition, a cosmid containing the GPT sequence also contains a previously unmapped, polymorphic microsatellite sequence, D8S421. The cloned GPT gene and associated polymorphisms will be useful for linkage and physical mapping of disease loci that map to the terminus of 8q, including atypical vitelliform macular dystrophy (VMD1) and epidermolysis bullosa simplex, type Ogna (EBS1). In addition, this will be a useful system for characterizing the telomeric region of 8q. Finally, determination of the molecular basis of the GPT isozyme variants will permit PCR-based detection of this world-wide polymorphism.

Am J Hum Genet. 1983 Jan;35(1):78-84. One hundred twenty-eight blood samples were drawn from members of a single family with atypical vitelliform macular dystrophy (VMD-1) characterized by variable expressivity in affected members of at least 5 generations. Because of the late onset of detectable retinal lesions in most family members, phenotype data from only 93 individuals who were at least 14 years of age were analyzed for linkage. Phenotype data from the remaining 35 members of the family who were under age 14 were excluded from the analysis. Maximum-likelihood analysis for linkage between VMD-1 and 13 biochemical and serological markers in the family demonstrated linkage between VMD-1 and the soluble glutamate pyruvate transaminase (GPT1) locus, which has been tentatively assigned to the short arm of chromosome 16. A maximum lod score of Z = 4.34 (odds favoring linkage of approximately 22,000 to 1) was obtained at a recombination fraction of theta = .05.

Clin Genet. 1988 Jul;34(1):26-30. Genetic linkage studies are presented for nine kindreds with Best's vitelliform macular dystrophy (BVMD). This condition is an autosomal dominant macular dystrophy with reduced penetrance and highly variable expressivity. Asymptomatic carriers were identified with electro-oculography, fundus photographs and fluorescein angiography. Blood and saliva specimens were obtained from informative family members and genotyped for 26 polymorphic genetic traits. No firm evidence was found for linkage between BVMD and 18 informative markers; the highest positive lod score was z = 0.57 for GPT1 at a recombination fraction of theta = 0.30. An atypical form of vitelliform macular dystrophy (VMD-1) is linked to GPT1 (theta less than 0.05) and is provisionally assigned to chromosome 16pter-p11. Our data are not sufficient to rule out loose linkage for GPT1 and BVMD. Thus we were not able to determine whether BVMD and VMD-1 are allelic mutations or separate genetic disorders. Additional linkage and gene mapping studies of these loci and BVMD (as well as other atypical forms of macular dystrophy) would be useful to further delineate these disorders.

Genomics. 1997 Mar 1;40(2):247-52. Two frequent protein variants of glutamate pyruvate transminase (GPT) (E.C.2.6.1.2) have been used as genetic markers in humans for more than two decades, although chromosomal mapping of the GPT locus in the 1980s produced conflicting results. To resolve this conflict and develop useful DNA markers for this gene, we isolated and characterized cDNA and genomic clones of GPT. We have definitively mapped human GPT to the terminus of 8q using several methods. First, two cosmids shown to contain the GPT sequence were derived from a chromosome 8-specific library. Second, by fluorescence in situ hybridization, we mapped the cosmid containing the human GPT gene to chromosome band 8q24.3. Third, we mapped the rat gpt cDNA to the syntenic region of rat chromosome 7. Finally, PCR primers specific to human GPT amplify sequences contained within a "half-YAC" from the long arm of chromosome 8, that is, a YAC containing the 8q telomere. The human GPT genomic sequence spans 2,7 kb and consists of 11 exons, ranging in size from 79 to 243 bp. The exonic sequence encodes a protein of 495 amino acids that is nearly identical to the previously reported protein sequence of human GPT-1. The two polymorphic GPT isozymes are the results of a nucleotide substitution in codon 14, coding for a histidine in GPT-1 and an asparagine in GPT-2, which causes a gain or loss of an NlaIII restriction site. In addition, a cosmid containing the GPT sequence also contains a previously unmapped, polymorphic microsatellite sequence, D8S421. The cloned GPT gene and associated polymorphisms will be useful for linkage and physical mapping of disease loci that map to the terminus of 8q, including atypical vitelliform macular dystrophy (VMD1) and epidermolysis bullosa simplex, type Ogna (EBS1). In addition, this will be a useful system for characterizing the telomeric region of 8q.

Eye. 2007 May 11;. AimAge-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a common macular disease in the developed world and recent studies have shown that specific genes may be associated with it and may contribute to a higher risk of developing AMD.ObjectiveOur objective was to review systematically recent publications related to the genetics of AMD and provide relevant information that would help both scientists and clinicians in advising patients.MethodA systematic search was performed on PubMed, Medline, and National Library of Medicine as well as ARVO abstracts using key words relevant to the genetic associations of AMD.ResultsThe most important genetic associations in AMD involved the complement factor H (CFH) gene, which showed that possession of the variant Y402H polymorphism significantly increases the risk for AMD. Protective genes have also been identified such as those on either factor B (BFor complement factor B (CFB)) or complement component 2 (C2) genes. The genes involved in inherited macular dystrophies such as ATP-binding cassette, subfamily A (ABC1), member 4 (ABCA4), vitelliform macular dystrophy (VMD2), tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-3 (TIMP3), and EFEMP1have yielded some important information but further confirmatory work has yet to establish a clear association with AMD.ConclusionPatients with AMD possess specific genetic variants of the CFHgene, which put them at a higher risk of developing the disease. Other unaffected individuals may possess certain protective genetic variants, which could prevent them from developing AMD. Further research will no doubt shed light on other such mechanisms and these will be useful in identifying possible direct targets for drugs or indirectly through modulation of the genes responsible for disease presentation.Eye advance online publication, 11 May 2007; doi:10.1038/sj.eye.6702844.

Doc Ophthalmol. 2001 May;102(3):237-50. The results from literature concerning some aspects of retinal function in macular degenerations (MDs) were reviewed in order to evaluate whether (a) specific patterns of retinal dysfunction may be linked to different clinical phenotypes, and (b) distinct functional profiles may help in orienting molecular diagnosis of diseases. Examined clinical phenotypes included: Stargardt disease/fundus flavimaculatus (St/FF), age-related maculopathy (ARM) and macular degeneration (AMD), pattern dystrophies (PD), Best vitelliform dystrophy (BVD), Sorsby's fundus dystrophy (SFD), autosomal cone-rod dystrophies (CRD). The following functional tests were evaluated: (1) electroretinogram (ERG) (scotopic and photopic according to ISCEV standards, rod and cone photoresponses, rod and cone b-wave intensity-response function, focal ERGs); (2) dark adaptometry (pre-bleach sensitivity and post-bleach recovery kinetics); (3) fundus reflectometry (pigment density and regeneration kinetics). Specific patterns of retinal dysfunction were identified for St/FF, ARM/AMD, SFD and BVD, whereas partially overlapping profiles were found for PD and CRD. Specific functional patterns were associated with different peripherin/RDS gene mutations, as well as with CRX mutations. Combined analysis of different retinal function tests may help to identify different phenotypes of MD, and to orient molecular diagnosis for selected genotypes.

A genetically homogeneous disease] . BACKGROUND: The recent identification of the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-3 (TIMP3) as the gene underlying SFD pathology has made it possible to address the question of genetic heterogeneity in this disorder. In addition, it now has become feasible to clarify whether SFD is directly involved in other maculopathies and, in particular, may represent a genetic model for age-related macular degeneration. PATIENTS: Genetic analysis were performed in five unrelated and 18 related British SFD pedigrees as well as in 143 patients affected with age-related macular degeneration, 28 patients with adult vitelliform macular dystrophy, 21 patients with central areolar choroidal dystrophy and 25 individuals with other forms of macular dystrophies. RESULTS: Molecular genetic analyses confirmed the autosomal dominant mode of inheritance in SFD. In all five unrelated SFD pedigrees individual TIMP3 mutations were identified introducing an additional cysteine residue into the C-terminal region of the mature protein. Affected individuals from 18 SFD families residing in Great Britain, Canada, Oregon and South Africa were found to carry a common ancestral Ser181Cys mutation. The clinical variability of this Ser181Cys mutation was reevaluated. A mutational screen in 217 patients with various maculopathies revealed no disease-causing mutations in the TIMP3 gene. CONCLUSION: So far, TIMP3 mutations have exclusively been associated with SFD. Therefore, this disorder appears to be genetically homogeneous with complete penetrance but variable expressivity.

Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci. 1997 May;38(6):1054-9. PURPOSE: Mutations in the gene encoding the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-3 (TIMP3) have been shown previously to cause Sorsby's fundus dystrophy, an autosomal-dominant disorder characterized by extracellular matrix irregularities in Bruch's membrane. To assess the involvement of TIMP3 in a variety of other macular dystrophies, the authors have screened this gene for disease-causing mutations in age-related macular degeneration (AMD), adult vitelliform macular dystrophy (AVMD), central areolar choroidal dystrophy (CACD), syndrome-associated macular dystrophies, cone-rod dystrophy, and a group with unspecified macular degeneration. METHODS: Single-stranded conformational analysis of the entire coding region was performed using the polymerase chain reaction and oligonucleotide primers flanking the five exons of the TIMP3 gene as well as the putative promotor region and a highly conserved fragment of the 3'-untranslated region. The authors analyzed a total of 217 patients, including 143 patients with AMD, 28 patients with AVMD, 21 patients with CACD, and 25 patients with other forms of macular dystrophy. RESULTS: In the 217 patients analyzed, the authors have identified one sequence alteration (a G-to-C base change) in the 5'-untranslated region in a patient with AMD. However, the functional consequences of this mutation are not clear. No other disease-causing mutations were found. The authors have characterized a frequent intragenic polymorphism in exon 3 of the TIMP3 gene (heterozygosity = 0.57) that will be useful for genetic linkage or allele sharing analyses or both. CONCLUSIONS: The authors' results suggest that TIMP3 is not a major factor in the cause of AMD, AVMD, and CACD. Thus far, Sorsby's fundus dystrophy appears to be the only phenotype known to be associated with mutations in TIMP3.

Vitelliform_macular_dystrophy	VMD2	Positive	PMID:17477921	Bakall B, Radu RA, Stanton JB, Burke JM, McKay BS, Wadelius C, Mullins RF, Stone EM, Travis GH, Marmorstein AD: Enhanced accumulation of A2E in individuals homozygous or heterozygous for mutations in BEST1 (VMD2). Exp Eye Res. 2007 Jul;85(1):34-43. Epub 2007 Mar 19. Best vitelliform macular dystrophy (BMD) is an autosomal dominant inherited macular degenerative disease caused by mutations in the gene BEST1 (formerly VMD2). Prior reports indicate that BMD is characterized histopathologically by accumulation of lipofuscin in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). However, this accumulation has not been quantified and the chemical composition of lipofuscin in BMD has not been examined. In this study we characterize the histopathology of a donor eye from a rare individual homozygous for a mutation (W93C) in BEST1. We find that this individual's disease was not any more severe than has been described for heterozygotes. We then used this tissue to quantify lipofuscin accumulation by enriching intracellular granules from RPE cells on sucrose gradients and counting the granules in each density fraction. Granules from the homozygous donor eye as well as a donor eye from an individual heterozygous for the mutation T6R were compared with age-matched control eyes. Interestingly, the least dense fraction, representing classical lipofuscin granules was either not present or significantly diminished in the BMD donor eyes and the autoflourescence associated with lipofuscin had shifted to denser fractions. However, a substantial enrichment for granules in fractions of higher density was also noted in the BMD samples. Inspection of granules from the homozygous donor eye by electron microscopy revealed a complex abnormal multilobular structure. Analysis of granules by HPLC indicated a approximately 1.6- and approximately fourfold overall increase in A2E in the BMD eyes versus age-matched control eyes, with a shift of A2E to more dense granules in the BMD donor eyes. Despite the increase in A2E and total intracellular granules, the RPE in the homozygous donor eyes was relatively well preserved. Based on these data we conclude that the clinical and histopathologic consequences to the homozygous donor were not any more severe than has been reported previously for individuals who are established or presumptive heterozygotes. We find that A2E is a component of the lipofuscin accumulated in BMD and that it is more abundant than in control eyes suggesting that the etiology of BMD is similar to Stargardt's disease and Stargardt-like macular dystrophy. Finally, the changes we observe in the granules suggest that the histopathology and eventual vision loss associated with BMD may be due to defects in the ability of the RPE to fully degrade phagocytosed photoreceptor outer segments.
Vitelliform_macular_dystrophy	VMD2	Positive	PMID:17287362	Marchant D, Yu K, Bigot K, Roche O, Germain A, Bonneau D, Drouin-Garraud V, Schorderet DF, Munier F, Schmidt D, Le Neindre P, Marsac C, Menasche M, Dufier JL, Fischmeister R, Hartzell C, Abitbol M: New VMD2 gene mutations identified in patients affected by Best vitelliform macular dystrophy. J Med Genet. 2007 Mar;44(3):e70. Epub 2007 Feb 7. PURPOSE: The mutations responsible for Best vitelliform macular dystrophy (BVMD) are found in a gene called VMD2. The VMD2 gene encodes a transmembrane protein named bestrophin-1 (hBest1) which is a Ca (2+)-sensitive chloride channel. This study was performed to identify disease-specific mutations in 27 patients with BVMD. Because this disease is characterised by an alteration in Cl (-) channel function, patch clamp analysis was used to test the hypothesis that one of the VMD2 mutated variants causes the disease. METHODS: Direct sequencing analysis of the 11 VMD2 exons was performed to detect new abnormal sequences. The mutant of hBest1 was expressed in HEK-293 cells and the associated Cl (-) current was examined using whole-cell patch clamp analysis. RESULTS: Six new VMD2 mutations were identified, located exclusively in exons four, six and eight. One of these mutations (Q293H) was particularly severe. Patch clamp analysis of human embryonic kidney cells expressing the Q293H mutant showed that this mutant channel is non-functional. Furthermore, the Q293H mutant inhibited the function of wild-type bestrophin-1 channels in a dominant negative manner. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides further support for the idea that mutations in VMD2 are a necessary factor for Best disease. However, because variable expressivity of VMD2 was observed in a family with the Q293H mutation, it is also clear that a disease-linked mutation in VMD2 is not sufficient to produce BVMD. The finding that the Q293H mutant does not form functional channels in the membrane could be explained either by disruption of channel conductance or gating mechanisms or by improper trafficking of the protein to the plasma membrane.
Vitelliform_macular_dystrophy	VMD2	Positive	PMID:17110374	Milenkovic VM, Rivera A, Horling F, Weber BH: Insertion and topology of normal and mutant bestrophin-1 in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. J Biol Chem. 2007 Jan 12;282(2):1313-21. Epub 2006 Nov 15. The vitelliform macular dystrophy type 2 (VMD2) gene mutated in Best macular dystrophy encodes a 585-amino acid putative transmembrane protein termed bestrophin-1. The vast majority of known disease-associated alterations are of the missense type, which cluster near predicted transmembrane domains (TMDs). To investigate bestrophin-1 membrane topology and to assess consequences of point mutations on membrane integration, we have analyzed the insertion of putative TMDs into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. Out of six potential TMDs, our data suggest a topological model of bestrophin-1 with four transmembrane-spanning segments and one large cytoplasmatic loop between putative TMD2 and TMD5. Consequently, a relatively hydrophobic segment containing putative TMD3 (aa 130-149) and TMD4 (aa 179-201) is located within the cytoplasm. Furthermore, we show that three out of 18 disease-associated alterations investigated (I73N, Y85H, F281del) reveal measurable effects on membrane insertion suggesting that defective membrane integration of bestrophin-1 may represent a potential disease mechanism for a small subset of Best macular dystrophy-related mutations.
Vitelliform_macular_dystrophy	VMD2	Positive	PMID:17065513	Yu K, Cui Y, Hartzell HC: The bestrophin mutation A243V, linked to adult-onset vitelliform macular dystrophy, impairs its chloride channel function. Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci. 2006 Nov;47(11):4956-61. PURPOSE: It has been proposed that Best vitelliform macular dystrophy (BVMD) is caused by dysfunction in the Cl (-) channel function of human bestrophin-1 (hBest1), but some patients with BVMD who have the hBest1 A243V mutation have normal electro-oculograms, suggesting that this mutation may not affect Cl (-) channel function. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the A243V mutation affects the Cl (-) channel function of hBest1. METHODS: Wild-type alanine at position 243 was changed to valine by PCR-based mutagenesis. Wild-type (WT) and A243V hBest1 were transfected into HEK-293 cells, and Cl (-) currents were measured with the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. The trafficking of proteins to the plasma membrane was tested by cell-surface biotinylation. RESULTS: WT hBest1 induced Ca (2+)-activated Cl (-) currents in HEK cells that were > 1 nA in amplitude. The currents produced by the A243V mutant, however, were only approximately 10% as large as WT. This was not due to the inability of the A243V mutant to reach the plasma membrane, as shown by cell-surface biotinylation. The A243V mutation changed channel anion selectivity. The WT current exhibited a relative permeability P (X)/P (Cl) order of SCN (-) > or = I (-) > or = NO (3)(-) > Br (-) > Cl (-) > HCO (3)(-) and a relative conductance G (X)/G (Cl) order of NO (3)(-) > SCN (-) > I (-) > or = Br (-) > or = Cl (-) > HCO (3)(-). However, the A243V current exhibited different sequences: P (X)/P (Cl) was SCN (-) > NO (3)(-) > I (-) > Br (-) > Cl (-) > HCO (3)(-) and G (X)/G (Cl) was SCN (-) > NO (3)(-) > or = I (-) > or = Br (-) > Cl (-) > HCO (3)(-). Unlike several other hBest1 mutations that have dominant-negative effects on wild-type channels, the A243V-mutation did not influence the wild-type current when A243V and WT hBest1 were transfected together. CONCLUSIONS: The disease-causing A243V mutation is associated with altered hBest1 Cl (-) channel activity. The absence of a dominant negative effect of A243V is consistent with the more mild symptoms associated with this mutation. These results are interpreted in terms of the hypotheses that bestrophins are Cl (-) channels and regulators of Ca signaling.
Vitelliform_macular_dystrophy	VMD2	Positive	PMID:16865191	Li Y, Wang G, Dong B, Sun X, Turner MJ, Kamaya S, Zhang K: A novel mutation of the VMD2 gene in a Chinese family with best vitelliform macular dystrophy. Ann Acad Med Singapore. 2006 Jun;35(6):408-10. INTRODUCTION: In this paper, we report a novel VMD2 gene mutation in a Chinese family with Best vitelliform macular dystrophy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ophthalmologic examination and optical coherence tomography (OCT) were performed in 2 members of this family. Mutational screening was performed by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and direct sequencing of PCR-amplified DNA fragments, corresponding to the 11 exons of the gene. RESULTS: Sequence analysis identified a previously unreported C to G change, predicting a Phe-113-Leu substitution. Both the proband and his sister harboured this novel mutation. Each had bilateral vitelliform lesions. CONCLUSIONS: A novel mutation in the VMD2 gene (C427G) was found in Chinese patients with Best vitelliform macular dystrophy.
Vitelliform_macular_dystrophy	VMD2	Positive	PMID:16754206	Schatz P, Klar J, Andreasson S, Ponjavic V, Dahl N: Variant phenotype of Best vitelliform macular dystrophy associated with compound heterozygous mutations in VMD2. Ophthalmic Genet. 2006 Jun;27(2):51-6. PURPOSE: To characterize the phenotype of members of a Swedish family with Best macular dystrophy and two distinct mutations in VMD2. METHODS: Venous blood samples were obtained from six family members and screened for mutations in VMD2. Six individuals were examined clinically, four of whom were further investigated with full-field electroretinography (ERG), electro-oculography (EOG), multifocal electroretinography (mfERG), and optical coherence tomography (OCT). RESULTS: The VMD2 mutations resulting in Arg141His and Tyr29stop were identified in family members. Two individuals harbored both mutations, one mutation in each VMD2 allele. These two family members had an abnormal EOG and their full-field ERG demonstrated widespread degeneration with a prolonged implicit time in the cone 30-Hz flicker ERG. MfERG verified reduction of the central retinal function and OCT demonstrated intraretinal fluid, swelling, and thickening of the outer retina-RPE-choroid complex (ORCC). CONCLUSION: A previously undescribed severe form of Best macular dystrophy is associated with compound heterozygous mutations in VMD2.
Vitelliform_macular_dystrophy	VMD2	Positive	PMID:16678528	Maruko I, Iida T, Spaide RF, Kishi S: Indocyanine green angiography abnormality of the periphery in vitelliform macular dystrophy. Am J Ophthalmol. 2006 May;141(5):976-8. PURPOSE: To report the peripheral abnormalities seen only with indocyanine green angiography in patients with vitelliform macular dystrophy (Best disease, caused by a mutation in the bestrophin gene). DESIGN: Observational case report series. METHODS: Eight eyes of four patients, two with only a central macular lesion and two with multifocal lesions, were studied. Results of indocyanine green angiography were compared with findings from ophthalmoscopy and fluorescein angiography. RESULTS: Throughout the fundus periphery, indocyanine green angiography demonstrated a number of hyperfluorescent spots in all eight eyes. The spots were observed in the midperiphery and the periphery in areas with no abnormality visible by ophthalmoscopy or fluorescein angiography. CONCLUSIONS: Although Best disease generally causes lesions visible in the posterior pole, the extensive distribution of the hyperfluorescent spots is consistent with the wide-ranging abnormalities of the retinal pigment epithelium, Bruch membrane, and the choroid as seen histopathologically.
Vitelliform_macular_dystrophy	VMD2	Positive	PMID:16636205	Marmorstein LY, Wu J, McLaughlin P, Yocom J, Karl MO, Neussert R, Wimmers S, Stanton JB, Gregg RG, Strauss O, Peachey NS, Marmorstein AD: The light peak of the electroretinogram is dependent on voltage-gated calcium channels and antagonized by bestrophin (best-1). J Gen Physiol. 2006 May;127(5):577-89. Mutations in VMD2, encoding bestrophin (best-1), cause Best vitelliform macular dystrophy (BMD), adult-onset vitelliform macular dystrophy (AVMD), and autosomal dominant vitreoretinochoroidopathy (ADVIRC). BMD is distinguished from AVMD by a diminished electrooculogram light peak (LP) in the absence of changes in the flash electroretinogram. Although the LP is thought to be generated by best-1, we find enhanced LP luminance responsiveness with normal amplitude in Vmd2-/- mice and no differences in cellular Cl- currents in comparison to Vmd2+/+ littermates. The putative Ca2+ sensitivity of best-1, and our recent observation that best-1 alters the kinetics of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (VDCC), led us to examine the role of VDCCs in the LP. Nimodipine diminished the LP, leading us to survey VDCC beta-subunit mutant mice. Lethargic mice, which harbor a loss of function mutation in the beta4 subunit of VDCCs, exhibited a significant shift in LP luminance response, establishing a role for Ca2+ in LP generation. When stimulated with ATP, which increases [Ca++] I, retinal pigment epithelial cells derived from Vmd2-/- mice exhibited a fivefold greater response than Vmd2+/+ littermates, indicating that best-1 can suppress the rise in [Ca2+] I associated with the LP. We conclude that VDCCs regulated by a beta4 subunit are required to generate the LP and that best-1 antagonizes the LP luminance response potentially via its ability to modulate VDCC function. Furthermore, we suggest that the loss of vision associated with BMD is not caused by the same pathologic process as the diminished LP, but rather is caused by as yet unidentified effects of best-1 on other cellular processes.
Vitelliform_macular_dystrophy	VMD2	Positive	PMID:16282372	Rosenthal R, Bakall B, Kinnick T, Peachey N, Wimmers S, Wadelius C, Marmorstein A, Strauss O: Expression of bestrophin-1, the product of the VMD2 gene, modulates voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels in retinal pigment epithelial cells. FASEB J. 2006 Jan;20(1):178-80. Epub 2005 Nov 10. Mutations in the VMD2 gene cause Best's disease, an inherited form of macular degeneration. The reduction in the light-peak amplitude in the patient's electro-oculogram suggests that bestrophin-1 influences the membrane conductance of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Systemic application of the L-type Ca2+ channel blocker nimodipine reduced the light-peak amplitude in the rat electroretinogram but not a- and b-waves. Expression of bestrophin-1 in a RPE cell line (RPE-J) led to changes in L-type channel properties. Wild-type bestrophin-1 induced an acceleration of activation kinetics of Ba2+ currents through L-type Ca2+ channels and a shift of the voltage-dependent activation to more negative values, closer to the resting potential of RPE cells. Expression of bestrophin-1 with Best disease-causing mutations led to comparable shifts in voltage-dependent activation but different effects on activation and inactivation kinetics. Bestrophin W93C exhibited slowed activation and inactivation, and bestrophin R218C accelerated the activation and inactivation. Thus, transfection of RPE cells with bestrophin-1 distinctively changed L-type Ca2+ channel kinetics and voltage-dependence. On the basis of these data, we propose that presence of bestrophin-1 influences kinetics and voltage-dependence of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels and that these effects might open new ways to understand the mechanisms leading to retinal degeneration in Best's disease.
Vitelliform_macular_dystrophy	VMD2	Positive	PMID:16154901	Hagen AR, Barabote RD, Saier MH: The bestrophin family of anion channels: identification of prokaryotic homologues. Mol Membr Biol. 2005 Jul-Aug;22(4):291-302. The human disease protein, Bestrophin-1, associated with vitelliform macular dystrophy, has recently been shown to be an integral membrane anion channel-forming protein. In this study we have recovered all bestrophin homologues from the NCBI database and analyzed their sequences using bioinformatic approaches. Eukaryotic homologues were found in animals and fungi but not in plants or protozoans, and prokaryotic homologues distantly related to the eukaryotic proteins, were identified in certain Gram-negative bacterial kingdoms but not in Gram-positive bacteria or archaea. Our analyses suggest a uniform 4 TMS topology for most of these homologues with regions of conservation overlapping and preceding the odd numbered TMSs and overlapping and following the even numbered TMSs. Well-conserved motifs were identified in both the eukaryotic and the prokaryotic homologues, and these proved to overlap, suggesting common structural and functional properties. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that the eukaryotic proteins cluster according to organismal type, and that the prokaryotic proteins sometimes (but not always) do so. This suggests that eukaryotic paralogues arose exclusively by recent gene duplication events although both early and late gene duplication events occurred in prokaryotes.
Vitelliform_macular_dystrophy	peripherin	Positive	PMID:16636205	Marmorstein LY, Wu J, McLaughlin P, Yocom J, Karl MO, Neussert R, Wimmers S, Stanton JB, Gregg RG, Strauss O, Peachey NS, Marmorstein AD: The light peak of the electroretinogram is dependent on voltage-gated calcium channels and antagonized by bestrophin (best-1). J Gen Physiol. 2006 May;127(5):577-89. Mutations in VMD2, encoding bestrophin (best-1), cause Best vitelliform macular dystrophy (BMD), adult-onset vitelliform macular dystrophy (AVMD), and autosomal dominant vitreoretinochoroidopathy (ADVIRC). BMD is distinguished from AVMD by a diminished electrooculogram light peak (LP) in the absence of changes in the flash electroretinogram. Although the LP is thought to be generated by best-1, we find enhanced LP luminance responsiveness with normal amplitude in Vmd2-/- mice and no differences in cellular Cl- currents in comparison to Vmd2+/+ littermates. The putative Ca2+ sensitivity of best-1, and our recent observation that best-1 alters the kinetics of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (VDCC), led us to examine the role of VDCCs in the LP. Nimodipine diminished the LP, leading us to survey VDCC beta-subunit mutant mice. Lethargic mice, which harbor a loss of function mutation in the beta4 subunit of VDCCs, exhibited a significant shift in LP luminance response, establishing a role for Ca2+ in LP generation. When stimulated with ATP, which increases [Ca++] I, retinal pigment epithelial cells derived from Vmd2-/- mice exhibited a fivefold greater response than Vmd2+/+ littermates, indicating that best-1 can suppress the rise in [Ca2+] I associated with the LP. We conclude that VDCCs regulated by a beta4 subunit are required to generate the LP and that best-1 antagonizes the LP luminance response potentially via its ability to modulate VDCC function. Furthermore, we suggest that the loss of vision associated with BMD is not caused by the same pathologic process as the diminished LP, but rather is caused by as yet unidentified effects of best-1 on other cellular processes.
Vitelliform_macular_dystrophy	peripherin	Positive	PMID:10737974	White K, Marquardt A, Weber BH: VMD2 mutations in vitelliform macular dystrophy (Best disease) and other maculopathies. Hum Mutat. 2000;15(4):301-8. Mutations in the gene VMD2 are associated with autosomal dominant vitelliform macular dystrophy (Best disease). VMD2 is expressed in the retinal pigment epithelium and codes for a 585 amino acid putative transmembrane protein with undetermined functional properties. To date, 48 different mutations, predominantly missense, have been described in Best disease families. These mutations generally affect amino acids in the first 50% of the protein, and occur in four distinct clusters possibly representing regions of functional importance. VMD2 has also been investigated in other macular diseases. Mutations have been documented in a significant percentage of patients with adult vitelliform macular dystrophy (AVMD) and in a single case of "bull's-eye" maculopathy. Results of analysis in two large series of individuals with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) suggest that VMD2 does not play a major role in this prevalent disorder.

Mol Vis. 1999 Nov 3;5:30. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is increasingly recognized as a complex genetic disorder in which one or more genes contribute to an individual's susceptibility for developing the condition. Twin and family studies as well as population-based genetic epidemiologic methods have convincingly demonstrated the importance of genetics in AMD, though the extent of heritability, the number of genes involved, and the phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity of the condition remain unresolved. The extent to which other hereditary macular dystrophies such as Stargardts disease, familial radial drusen (malattia leventinese), Best's disease, and peripherin/RDS-related dystrophy are related to AMD remains unclear. Alzheimer's disease, another late onset, heterogeneous degenerative disorder of the central nervous system, offers a valuable model for identifying the issues that confront AMD genetics.

Vitelliform_macular_dystrophy	peripherin	Positive	PMID:9338584	Felbor U, Schilling H, Weber BH: Adult vitelliform macular dystrophy is frequently associated with mutations in the peripherin/RDS gene. Hum Mutat. 1997;10(4):301-9. Mutations in the peripherin/RDS gene, which encodes a photoreceptor-specific membrane glycoprotein, have been identified in a variety of retinal phenotypes. However, the mechanisms by which specific mutations in this gene can cause typical features of retinal dystrophies clinically as distinct as retinitis pigmentosa or macular degeneration are still unknown. Recently, a single case of adult vitelliform macular dystrophy (AVMD) has been associated with a Y258Stop mutation. To assess the frequency of peripherin/RDS mutations in the clinically heterogeneous group of AVMD, we analyzed the entire coding region of the gene in 28 unrelated patients. We identified five novel mutations including two presumed null allele mutations. Thus, our results demonstrate that a significant portion of AVMD patients (18%) carry point mutations in peripherin/RDS, suggesting that this gene is frequently involved in the pathogenesis of this macular disorder. In addition, this study shows that the variable phenotypes in AVMD are due, at least in part, to genetic heterogeneity and are likely to be caused by mutations in disease genes thus far unknown.
Vitelliform_macular_dystrophy	peripherin	Positive	PMID:9152224	Felbor U, Doepner D, Schneider U, Zrenner E, Weber BH: Evaluation of the gene encoding the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-3 in various maculopathies. Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci. 1997 May;38(6):1054-9. PURPOSE: Mutations in the gene encoding the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-3 (TIMP3) have been shown previously to cause Sorsby's fundus dystrophy, an autosomal-dominant disorder characterized by extracellular matrix irregularities in Bruch's membrane. To assess the involvement of TIMP3 in a variety of other macular dystrophies, the authors have screened this gene for disease-causing mutations in age-related macular degeneration (AMD), adult vitelliform macular dystrophy (AVMD), central areolar choroidal dystrophy (CACD), syndrome-associated macular dystrophies, cone-rod dystrophy, and a group with unspecified macular degeneration. METHODS: Single-stranded conformational analysis of the entire coding region was performed using the polymerase chain reaction and oligonucleotide primers flanking the five exons of the TIMP3 gene as well as the putative promotor region and a highly conserved fragment of the 3'-untranslated region. The authors analyzed a total of 217 patients, including 143 patients with AMD, 28 patients with AVMD, 21 patients with CACD, and 25 patients with other forms of macular dystrophy. RESULTS: In the 217 patients analyzed, the authors have identified one sequence alteration (a G-to-C base change) in the 5'-untranslated region in a patient with AMD. However, the functional consequences of this mutation are not clear. No other disease-causing mutations were found. The authors have characterized a frequent intragenic polymorphism in exon 3 of the TIMP3 gene (heterozygosity = 0.57) that will be useful for genetic linkage or allele sharing analyses or both. CONCLUSIONS: The authors' results suggest that TIMP3 is not a major factor in the cause of AMD, AVMD, and CACD. Thus far, Sorsby's fundus dystrophy appears to be the only phenotype known to be associated with mutations in TIMP3.
Vitelliform_macular_dystrophy	chloride-channel	Negative	PMID:17065513	Yu K, Cui Y, Hartzell HC: The bestrophin mutation A243V, linked to adult-onset vitelliform macular dystrophy, impairs its chloride channel function. Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci. 2006 Nov;47(11):4956-61. PURPOSE: It has been proposed that Best vitelliform macular dystrophy (BVMD) is caused by dysfunction in the Cl (-) channel function of human bestrophin-1 (hBest1), but some patients with BVMD who have the hBest1 A243V mutation have normal electro-oculograms, suggesting that this mutation may not affect Cl (-) channel function. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the A243V mutation affects the Cl (-) channel function of hBest1. METHODS: Wild-type alanine at position 243 was changed to valine by PCR-based mutagenesis. Wild-type (WT) and A243V hBest1 were transfected into HEK-293 cells, and Cl (-) currents were measured with the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. The trafficking of proteins to the plasma membrane was tested by cell-surface biotinylation. RESULTS: WT hBest1 induced Ca (2+)-activated Cl (-) currents in HEK cells that were > 1 nA in amplitude. The currents produced by the A243V mutant, however, were only approximately 10% as large as WT. This was not due to the inability of the A243V mutant to reach the plasma membrane, as shown by cell-surface biotinylation. The A243V mutation changed channel anion selectivity. The WT current exhibited a relative permeability P (X)/P (Cl) order of SCN (-) > or = I (-) > or = NO (3)(-) > Br (-) > Cl (-) > HCO (3)(-) and a relative conductance G (X)/G (Cl) order of NO (3)(-) > SCN (-) > I (-) > or = Br (-) > or = Cl (-) > HCO (3)(-). However, the A243V current exhibited different sequences: P (X)/P (Cl) was SCN (-) > NO (3)(-) > I (-) > Br (-) > Cl (-) > HCO (3)(-) and G (X)/G (Cl) was SCN (-) > NO (3)(-) > or = I (-) > or = Br (-) > Cl (-) > HCO (3)(-). Unlike several other hBest1 mutations that have dominant-negative effects on wild-type channels, the A243V-mutation did not influence the wild-type current when A243V and WT hBest1 were transfected together. CONCLUSIONS: The disease-causing A243V mutation is associated with altered hBest1 Cl (-) channel activity. The absence of a dominant negative effect of A243V is consistent with the more mild symptoms associated with this mutation. These results are interpreted in terms of the hypotheses that bestrophins are Cl (-) channels and regulators of Ca signaling.
Vitelliform_macular_dystrophy	ABCA4	Negative	PMID:17491602	Patel N, Adewoyin T, Chong NV: Age-related macular degeneration: a perspective on genetic studies. Eye. 2007 May 11;. AimAge-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a common macular disease in the developed world and recent studies have shown that specific genes may be associated with it and may contribute to a higher risk of developing AMD.ObjectiveOur objective was to review systematically recent publications related to the genetics of AMD and provide relevant information that would help both scientists and clinicians in advising patients.MethodA systematic search was performed on PubMed, Medline, and National Library of Medicine as well as ARVO abstracts using key words relevant to the genetic associations of AMD.ResultsThe most important genetic associations in AMD involved the complement factor H (CFH) gene, which showed that possession of the variant Y402H polymorphism significantly increases the risk for AMD. Protective genes have also been identified such as those on either factor B (BFor complement factor B (CFB)) or complement component 2 (C2) genes. The genes involved in inherited macular dystrophies such as ATP-binding cassette, subfamily A (ABC1), member 4 (ABCA4), vitelliform macular dystrophy (VMD2), tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-3 (TIMP3), and EFEMP1have yielded some important information but further confirmatory work has yet to establish a clear association with AMD.ConclusionPatients with AMD possess specific genetic variants of the CFHgene, which put them at a higher risk of developing the disease. Other unaffected individuals may possess certain protective genetic variants, which could prevent them from developing AMD. Further research will no doubt shed light on other such mechanisms and these will be useful in identifying possible direct targets for drugs or indirectly through modulation of the genes responsible for disease presentation.Eye advance online publication, 11 May 2007; doi:10.1038/sj.eye.6702844.
Vitelliform_macular_dystrophy	ROM1	Negative	PMID:8279475	Nichols BE, Bascom R, Litt M, McInnes R, Sheffield VC, Stone EM: Refining the locus for Best vitelliform macular dystrophy and mutation analysis of the candidate gene ROM1. Am J Hum Genet. 1994 Jan;54(1):95-103. Vitelliform macular dystrophy (Best disease) is an autosomal dominant macular dystrophy which shares important clinical features with age-related macular degeneration, the most common cause of legal blindness in the elderly. Unfortunately, our understanding and treatment for this common age-related disorder is limited. Discovery of the gene which causes Best disease has the potential to increase our understanding of the pathogenesis of all types of macular degeneration, including the common age-related form. Best disease has recently been mapped to chromosome 11q13. The photoreceptor-specific protein ROM1 has also been recently mapped to this location, and the ROM1 gene is a candidate gene for Best disease. Using highly polymorphic markers, we have narrowed the genetic region which contains the Best disease gene to the 10-cM region between markers D11S871 and PYGM. Marker D11S956 demonstrated no recombinants with Best disease in three large families and resulted in a lod score of 18.2. In addition, a polymorphism within the ROM1 gene also demonstrated no recombinants and resulted in a lod score of 10.0 in these same three families. We used a combination of SSCP analysis, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, and DNA sequencing to screen the entire coding region of the ROM1 gene in 11 different unrelated patients affected with Best disease. No nucleotide changes were found in the coding sequence of any affected patient, indicating that mutations within the coding sequence are unlikely to cause Best disease.
Vitelliform_macular_dystrophy	ROM1	Negative	PMID:7860071	Stohr H, Weber BH: A recombination event excludes the ROM1 locus from the Best's vitelliform macular dystrophy region. Hum Genet. 1995 Feb;95(2):219-22. Best's vitelliform macular degeneration has been genetically linked to chromosome 11. Subsequently, the disease locus has been refined to an interval between D11S903 and PYGM and, more recently, between D11S986 and D11S480. The gene encoding ROM1, a photoreceptor-specific membrane protein, has been independently mapped within the Best's disease region and has thus become a strong candidate for the Best's disease gene. In this study, we have mapped ROM1 relative to Best's disease and the loci D11S986, UGB (uteroglobin), and PYGM (human muscle glycogen phosphorylase) in recombinant Best's disease chromosomes. We demonstrate that UGB is localized proximal to ROM1 and that both UGB and ROM1 recombine with the disease phenotype. Thus, this analysis excluded ROM1 as the Best's disease gene.
motor_neuron_disease	Apolipoprotein-E	Positive	PMID:10833320	Pickering-Brown SM, Owen F, Isaacs A, Snowden J, Varma A, Neary D, Furlong R, Daniel SE, Cairns NJ, Mann DM: Apolipoprotein E epsilon4 allele has no effect on age at onset or duration of disease in cases of frontotemporal dementia with pick- or microvacuolar-type histology. Exp Neurol. 2000 Jun;163(2):452-6. Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is the second most common cause of presenile dementia. Here we have investigated the frequency of the epsilon4 allele of the Apolipoprotein (APOE) gene in FTD and in other non-Alzheimer forms of dementia related to FTD such as Motor Neurone disease dementia, semantic dementia, progressive aphasia, progressive supranuclear palsy, and corticobasal degeneration. In none of these diagnostic groups did we find a significant increase in the APOE epsilon4 allelic frequency, compared to population values. Neither did we observe any affects of the epsilon4 allele upon age at onset or duration of disease. We conclude therefore that polymorphic variations in the APOE gene do not modulate either the occurrence or progression of these non-Alzheimer forms of dementia.

J Neurosci Res. 2003 Apr 1;72(1):54-64. We examined neuroprotective effects of recombinant adenoviral vectors encoding glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), cardiotrophin-1 (CT1), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1), and transforming growth factor-beta2 (TGFbeta2) on lesioned adult rat facial motoneurons. The right facial nerves of adult Fischer 344 male rats were avulsed and removed from the stylomastoid foramen, and adenoviral vectors were injected into the facial canal. Animals avulsed and treated with adenovirus encoding GDNF, BDNF, CNTF, CT1, IGF1 and TGFbeta2 showed intense immunolabeling for these factors in lesioned facial motoneurons, respectively, indicating adenoviral induction of the neurotrophic factors in these neurons. The treatment with adenovirus encoding GDNF, BDNF, or TGFbeta2 after avulsion significantly prevented the loss of lesioned facial motoneurons, improved choline acetyltransferase immunoreactivity and prevented the induction of nitric oxide synthase activity in these neurons. The treatment with adenovirus encoding CNTF, CT1 or IGF1, however, failed to protect these neurons after avulsion. These results indicate that the gene transfer of GDNF and BDNF and TGFbeta2 but not CNTF, CT1 or IGF1 may prevent the degeneration of motoneurons in adult humans with motoneuron injury and motor neuron diseases.

Am J Hum Genet. 2002 May;70(5):1277-86. Epub 2002 Apr 9. Mutations in the copper/zinc superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD-1) gene are found in approximately 20% of patients with familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FALS), or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 1. Here we describe a 25-year-old male patient who died from FALS after a rapid disease course of 11 mo. Sequencing of the SOD-1 gene revealed a heterozygous T--> G exchange at position 1513 within exon 5, coding for a V--> G substitution at position 148 of the mature protein. Genetic analysis of this family revealed the same mutation in both his healthy 35-year-old sister and his mother, who did not develop the disease before age 54 years. Screening for candidate modifier genes that might be responsible for the early onset and severe course of the disease in the 25-year-old patient revealed an additional homozygous mutation of the CNTF gene not found in his yet unaffected sister. hSOD-1G93A mice were crossbred with CNTF (-/-) mice and were investigated with respect to disease onset and duration, to test the hypothesis that CNTF acts as a candidate modifier gene in FALS with mutations in the SOD-1 gene. Such hSOD-1G93A/CNTF-deficient mice develop motoneuron disease at a significantly earlier stage than hSOD-1G93A/CNTF-wild-type mice. Linkage analysis revealed that the SOD-1 gene was solely responsible for the disease. However, disease onset as a quantitative trait was regulated by the allelic constitution at the CNTF locus. In addition, patients with sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis who had a homozygous CNTF gene defect showed significantly earlier disease onset but did not show a significant difference in disease duration. Thus, we conclude that CNTF acts as a modifier gene that leads to early onset of disease in patients with FALS who have SOD-1 mutations, in patients with sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and in the hSOD-1G93A mouse model.
motor_neuron_disease	ciliary-neurotrophic-factor	Positive	PMID:11259650	Lambert PD, Anderson KD, Sleeman MW, Wong V, Tan J, Hijarunguru A, Corcoran TL, Murray JD, Thabet KE, Yancopoulos GD, Wiegand SJ: Ciliary neurotrophic factor activates leptin-like pathways and reduces body fat, without cachexia or rebound weight gain, even in leptin-resistant obesity. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2001 Apr 10;98(8):4652-7. Epub 2001 Mar 20. Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor (CNTF) was first characterized as a trophic factor for motor neurons in the ciliary ganglion and spinal cord, leading to its evaluation in humans suffering from motor neuron disease. In these trials, CNTF caused unexpected and substantial weight loss, raising concerns that it might produce cachectic-like effects. Countering this possibility was the suggestion that CNTF was working via a leptin-like mechanism to cause weight loss, based on the findings that CNTF acts via receptors that are not only related to leptin receptors, but also similarly distributed within hypothalamic nuclei involved in feeding. However, although CNTF mimics the ability of leptin to cause fat loss in mice that are obese because of genetic deficiency of leptin (ob/ob mice), CNTF is also effective in diet-induced obesity models that are more representative of human obesity, and which are resistant to leptin. This discordance again raised the possibility that CNTF might be acting via nonleptin pathways, perhaps more analogous to those activated by cachectic cytokines. Arguing strongly against this possibility, we now show that CNTF can activate hypothalamic leptin-like pathways in diet-induced obesity models unresponsive to leptin, that CNTF improves prediabetic parameters in these models, and that CNTF acts very differently than the prototypical cachectic cytokine, IL-1. Further analyses of hypothalamic signaling reveals that CNTF can suppress food intake without triggering hunger signals or associated stress responses that are otherwise associated with food deprivation; thus, unlike forced dieting, cessation of CNTF treatment does not result in binge overeating and immediate rebound weight gain.

Arq Neuropsiquiatr. 2004 Mar;62(1):177-80. Epub 2004 Apr 28. Autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) is an heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative diseases involving cerebellum and its connections. Several forms have already been described, and it seems the most common form of SCA observed among the many series of families described worldwide is SCA3 (Machado-Joseph disease). SCA3 is characterized by a marked phenotypic expression with a wide spectrum of clinical findings including cerebellar ataxia, pyramidal and extrapyramidal (e.g. dystonia, parkinsonism), lower motor neuron syndrome and peripheral neuropathy. The Drew family of Walworth, England, has several affected members seen and described by famous neurologists including Gowers, Stewart, Collier, Kinnier-Wilson, Turner, Worster-Drought, Ferguson, Critchley, and Anita Harding from 1895 to our days. In fact, the final genetic diagnosis of this family, 100 years after its initial description, turned out to be SCA3. In this paper, we describe the full of twists and turns historical trajectory from the initial clinical description to the final genetic diagnosis.

Hum Mutat. 2007 Apr 13;. Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is the second most frequent type of neurodegenerative dementias. Mutations in the progranulin gene (GRN, PGRN) were recently identified in FTDU-17, an FTD subtype characterized by ubiquitin-immunoreactive inclusions and linkage to chromosome 17q21. We looked for PGRN mutations in a large series of 210 FTD patients (52 familial, 158 sporadic) to accurately evaluate the frequency of PGRN mutations in both sporadic and familial FTD, and FTD with associated motoneuron disease (FTD-MND), as well as to study the clinical phenotype of patients with a PGRN mutation. We identified nine novel PGRN null mutations in 10 index patients. The relative frequency of PGRN null mutations in FTD was 4.8% (10/210) and 12.8% (5/39) in pure familial forms. Interestingly, 5/158 (3.2%) apparently sporadic FTD patients carried a PGRN mutation, suggesting the possibility of de novo mutations or incomplete penetrance. In contrast, none of the 43 patients with FTD-MND had PGRN mutations, supporting that FTDU-17 and FTD-MND are genetically distinct. The clinical phenotype of PGRN mutation carriers was particular because of the wide range in onset age and the frequent occurrence of early apraxia (50%), visual hallucinations (30%), and parkinsonism (30%) during the course of the disease. This study supports that PGRN null mutations represent a more frequent cause of FTD than MAPT mutations (4.8% vs. 2.9%) but are not responsible for FTD-MND. It also demonstrates that half of the patients with a PGRN mutation in our series had no apparent family history of dementia. Taking this into account, genetic testing should be now considered more systematically, even in patients without obvious familial history of FTD. Hum Mutat 0, 1-10, 2007. (c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Brain. 2007 May;130(Pt 5):1375-85. Epub 2007 Mar 14. Frontotemporal dementia is accompanied by motor neuron disease (FTD + MND) in approximately 10% of cases. There is accumulating evidence for a clinicopathological overlap between FTD and MND based on observations of familial aggregation and neuropathological findings of ubiquitin-positive neuronal cytoplasmatic inclusions (NCI) in lower motor neurons, hippocampus and neocortex in both conditions. Several familial forms exist with different genetic loci and defects. We investigated the familial aggregation and clinical presentation of FTD + MND cases in a large cohort of 368 FTD patients in The Netherlands. Immunohistochemistry of available brain tissue of deceased patients was investigated using a panel of antibodies including ubiquitin, p62 and TAR DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa antibodies. A total of eight patients coming from six families had a family history positive for FTD + MND (mean age at onset 53.2 +/- 8.4 years). Five patients presented with behavioural changes and cognitive changes followed by motor neuron disease, whereas symptoms of motor neuron disease were the presenting features in the remaining three patients. Other affected relatives in these families showed dementia/FTD, MND or FTD + MND reflecting the clinical interfamilial variation. No mutations were identified in any of the candidate genes, including Superoxide Dismutase 1, dynactin, angiogenin, Microtubule-Associated Protein Tau, valosin-containing protein and progranulin. Available brain tissue of five patients with familial FTD + MND showed NCI in hippocampus, neocortex and spinal cord in all, and neuronal intranuclear inclusions (NII) in two brains. TDP-43 antibody showed robust staining of neuronal inclusions similar in distribution and morphology to NCI and NII. Additionally, TDP-43 antibody also stained ubiquitin-negative glial inclusions in the basal striatum of one case. In conclusion, there exists considerable clinical variation within families with FTD + MND, which may be determined by other genetic or environmental factors. NII are also found in some cases of familial FTD + MND without Progranulin mutations. The observation of glial TDP-43 positive inclusions in one brain is very interesting, although their pathophysiological significance is yet unknown.

Nature. 2006 Aug 24;442(7105):916-9. Epub 2006 Jul 16. Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is the second most common cause of dementia in people under the age of 65 years. A large proportion of FTD patients (35-50%) have a family history of dementia, consistent with a strong genetic component to the disease. In 1998, mutations in the gene encoding the microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) were shown to cause familial FTD with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17q21 (FTDP-17). The neuropathology of patients with defined MAPT mutations is characterized by cytoplasmic neurofibrillary inclusions composed of hyperphosphorylated tau. However, in multiple FTD families with significant evidence for linkage to the same region on chromosome 17q21 (D17S1787-D17S806), mutations in MAPT have not been found and the patients consistently lack tau-immunoreactive inclusion pathology. In contrast, these patients have ubiquitin (ub)-immunoreactive neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions and characteristic lentiform ub-immunoreactive neuronal intranuclear inclusions. Here we demonstrate that in these families, FTD is caused by mutations in progranulin (PGRN) that are likely to create null alleles. PGRN is located 1.7 Mb centromeric of MAPT on chromosome 17q21.31 and encodes a 68.5-kDa secreted growth factor involved in the regulation of multiple processes including development, wound repair and inflammation. PGRN has also been strongly linked to tumorigenesis. Moreover, PGRN expression is increased in activated microglia in many neurodegenerative diseases including Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, motor neuron disease and Alzheimer's disease. Our results identify mutations in PGRN as a cause of neurodegenerative disease and indicate the importance of PGRN function for neuronal survival.

Amyotroph Lateral Scler. 2007 Apr;8(2):67-72. Retroviral components of both exogenous and endogenous origins have been associated with nervous system diseases in both animals and humans. In the present study, the levels of transcripts from elements in the human endogenous retrovirus (HERV) W family were determined in muscle biopsies from patients with motor neuron disease (MND) and control subjects. Transcripts from the HERV-W element on chromosome 7q21.2 encoding syncytin and from the SOD1 gene were detected at elevated levels in biopsies from the most affected muscles from MND patients compared to biopsies from control individuals. According to a recent study, syncytin is expressed in microglia in normal brain and can be up-regulated in macrophages/microglia during inflammation. Although syncytin may have cytotoxic effects, it is therefore more likely that the present findings reflect a macrophage response in the muscles undergoing neurogenic atrophy than a primary pathogenetic event in MND.

Hum Mol Genet. 2006 Jan 15;15(2):167-87. Epub 2005 Dec 8. Spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress type 1 (SMARD1) is an infantile autosomal-recessive motor neuron disease caused by mutations in the immunoglobulin micro-binding protein 2. We investigated the potential of a spinal cord neural stem cell population isolated on the basis of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity to modify disease progression of nmd mice, an animal model of SMARD1. ALDH (hi) SSC (lo) stem cells are self-renewing and multipotent and when intrathecally transplanted in nmd mice generate motor neurons properly localized in the spinal cord ventral horns. Transplanted nmd animals presented delayed disease progression, sparing of motor neurons and ventral root axons and increased lifespan. To further investigate the molecular events responsible for these differences, microarray and real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analyses of wild-type, mutated and transplanted nmd spinal cord were undertaken. We demonstrated a down-regulation of genes involved in excitatory amino acid toxicity and oxidative stress handling, as well as an up-regulation of genes related to the chromatin organization in nmd compared with wild-type mice, suggesting that they may play a role in SMARD1 pathogenesis. Spinal cord of nmd-transplanted mice expressed high transcript levels for genes related to neurogenesis such as doublecortin (DCX), LIS1 and drebrin. The presence of DCX-expressing cells in adult nmd spinal cord suggests that both exogenous and endogenous neurogeneses may contribute to the observed nmd phenotype amelioration.

J Peripher Nerv Syst. 2004 Jun;9(2):79-91. Pathological studies, including novel teased peripheral nerve fiber studies, were performed in a patient who presented with a rapidly progressive, lower motor neuron syndrome and high titer of immunoglobulin M anti-GM1 ganglioside antibody. In the central nervous system, there was a severe loss of motor neurons and central chromatolysis with ubiquitin immunopositive cytoplasmic inclusions in residual motor neurons. In the peripheral nervous system, axonal degeneration of myelinated fibers in the anterior nerve roots was evident. Pathologic evidence of sensory nerve involvement was also found despite the absence of clinical or electrophysiological sensory abnormalities. Sectional studies of single myelinated nerve fibers from an antemortem sural nerve biopsy showed remyelination and globular paranodal swellings due to focal complex myelin folding and degeneration in 13% of fibers. Postmortem studies of the sural nerves 4 weeks later showed paranodal demyelination (90% of fibers), but no paranodal swellings and similar findings were present in samples of the ulnar, radial, median, tibial, and common peroneal nerves. Paranodal abnormalities of enlargement of the adaxonal space, myelin degeneration, and axonal compaction were found on cross-sectional studies of individual teased fibers, which on conventional light microscopic assessment appeared normal. These changes suggest a disturbance of paranodal axonal-myelin adhesion due to binding of the anti-GM1 ganglioside antibody to the common epitope known to be present on the myelin sheath and nodal axolemma in the paranodal region of both motor and sensory nerves.

Epub 2007 Mar 5. Regeneration in the peripheral nervous system is poor after chronic denervation. Denervated Schwann cells act as a "transient target" by secreting growth factors to promote regeneration of axons but lose this ability with chronic denervation. We discovered that the mRNA for pleiotrophin (PTN) was highly up-regulated in acutely denervated distal sciatic nerves, but high levels of PTN mRNA were not maintained in chronically denervated nerves. PTN protected spinal motor neurons against chronic excitotoxic injury and caused increased outgrowth of motor axons out of the spinal cord explants and formation of "miniventral rootlets." In neonatal mice, PTN protected the facial motor neurons against cell death induced by deprivation from target-derived growth factors. Similarly, PTN significantly enhanced regeneration of myelinated axons across a graft in the transected sciatic nerve of adult rats. Our findings suggest a neurotrophic role for PTN that may lead to previously unrecognized treatment options for motor neuron disease and motor axonal regeneration.

J Neurol Sci. 2006 Feb 15;241(1-2):39-43. Epub 2005 Nov 21. We evaluated the specific IgG antibodies against heat shock proteins (HSPs) in cerebrospinal fluids (CSF) from patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). ELISA was employed to examine IgG antibodies against ten HSPs (HSP27, alphaA and alphaB crystallins, HSP60, CCT, Mycobacterium bovis HSP65, Escherichia coli GroEL, HSP70, HSC70 and HSP90) in CSF from 30 patients with MS, and 25 patients with motor neuron diseases (MND). Significantly higher antibody titers against HSP70 and HSC70 proteins were found in CSF obtained from patients with MS as compared with MND independent of CSF total protein, IgG concentrations and IgG indices, respectively. The antibody titers against HSP70 were indicated to be significantly higher in the progressive cases than in cases of remission. The results suggest that IgG antibodies against specific types of HSPs especially HSP70 family proteins (HSP70 and HSC70) in CSF may play an important role in the pathophysiology of MS through the modification of immune response and cytoprotective functions of molecular chaperons.

J Neuroimmunol. 2004 Nov;156(1-2):204-9. We examined antibodies against 10 heat shock proteins (HSPs) in cerebrospinal fluids (CSF) and sera from patients with Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS). Significantly higher IgG antibody titers against HSP27, HSP60, HSP70 and HSP90 family, including mycobacterial HSP65 and Escherichia coli GroEL, were found in CSF from GBS patients as compared with motor neuron disease. Serum IgG antibodies against each HSP showed no difference between GBS patients and normal controls. GBS seems to be induced by reactive autoimmune responses frequently triggered by infections. The CSF antibodies against HSPs may modify the immune responses and/or cell-protective functions of HSPs in the pathophysiology of GBS.

Trends Mol Med. 2006 Aug;12(8):345-7. Epub 2006 Jul 14. A new study by Greenway and colleagues links mutations in the angiogenin gene to patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)--a progressive and fatal motoneuron disease. This is an unexpected finding because angiogenin was originally identified as a molecule involved in the formation of blood vessels (angiogenesis). Angiogenin bears striking similarity to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which is the prototypic angiogenic factor that has recently emerged as a molecule with important neuroprotective activities. Besides VEGF, angiogenin is the second so-called angiogenic factor implicated in ALS, raising the question of whether additional angiogenic factors might have a role in ALS. Overall, these findings identify angiogenin as a novel candidate gene in the pathogenesis of ALS--a discovery that ultimately might lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies.

Expert Rev Neurother. 2006 Mar;6(3):417-28. Although amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) was described more than 130 years ago, the cause (s) of most cases of this adult motor neuron disease remains a mystery. With the discovery of mutations in one gene (Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase) as a primary cause of some forms of ALS, model systems have been developed that have helped us begin to understand mechanisms involved in motor neuron death and enabled testing of potential new therapies. Several other genes have been implicated as risk factors in motor neuron diseases, including neurofilaments, cytoplasmic dynein and dynactin, vascular endothelial growth factor, and angiogenin. With advances in the basic research of the disease, many hypotheses accounting for motor neuron death are being explored, including loss of trophic support, protein mishandling, mitochondrial dysfunction, excitotoxicity, axonal abnormalities and inflammation. Many of these mechanisms are the focus of research in other neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and Huntington's disease.

Free Radic Biol Med. 2007 Jan 1;42(1):143-51. Epub 2006 Oct 20. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an adult-onset neurodegenerative disorder in which excitotoxicity has been implicated as a cause for cell death. To examine neurofilament (NF) aggregate-mediated sensitization of motor neurons to NMDA excitotoxicity, we examined NMDA receptor expression and the impact of NO donors (NOC12 or NOC5) or sodium cyanide (NaCN) on calcium influx and viability in dissociated motor neurons derived from wt and hNFL+/+ (NF aggregate-forming) mice. Alterations in intracellular calcium were assayed using Oregon Green calcium dye and the extent of apoptosis using active caspase-3 immunoreactivity. Although NF aggregate-bearing neurons demonstrated increased intracellular calcium levels and enhanced cell death in response to NMDA receptor activation, this was not associated with increased NMDA receptor expression. The down-regulation of the NMDA receptor using NO donors decreased calcium influx and caspase-3 activation in aggregate-bearing neurons, but had no effect on wt cultures. The converse was observed with NaCN in which intracellular calcium levels increased significantly in wt cultures in association with increased cell death. No effect was observed in aggregate-bearing neurons. These findings suggest that the presence of NF aggregates renders motor neurons more susceptible to NMDA-mediated excitotoxicity, and that this can be reversed by NO.
motor_neuron_disease	BSCL2	Positive	PMID:17387721	Ito D, Suzuki N: Molecular pathogenesis of seipin/BSCL2-related motor neuron diseases. Ann Neurol. 2007 Mar;61(3):237-50. OBJECTIVE: Heterozygous mutations in the Seipin/BSCL2 gene have recently been identified in two autosomal dominant motor neuron diseases, distal hereditary motor neuropathy type V and Silver's syndrome. Seipin protein is reportedly a transmembrane protein localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). N88S and S90L mutations of this protein disrupt its glycosylation, resulting in its aggregation, but the mechanism of neurodegeneration remains unclear. To clarify the molecular pathogenesis of seipin-related motor neuron diseases, we expressed wild-type and mutant seipin proteins in neuronal and nonneuronal cells. METHODS AND RESULTS: Coexpression of human seipin and ubiquitin showed that seipin is polyubiquitinated and its ubiquitination is enhanced by mutation. Treatment of cells with a proteasome inhibitor increased the amounts of mutant seipin in the cells, suggesting that they are degraded through the ER-associated degradation pathway. Immunoprecipitation studies showed that mutant seipin stably binds to the ER chaperone calnexin, indicating accumulation of unfolded mutant seipin in the ER. Furthermore, expression of mutant seipin increased the level of ER stress-mediated molecules and induced apoptosis in cultured cells. INTERPRETATION: These findings demonstrate that seipin/BSCL2-related motor neuron diseases are novel conformational diseases, and we suspect that they are tightly associated with ER stress-mediated cell death.

The presence of DCX-expressing cells in adult nmd spinal cord suggests that both exogenous and endogenous neurogeneses may contribute to the observed nmd phenotype amelioration.

Hum Mol Genet. 2005 Nov 1;14(21):3179-89. Epub 2005 Sep 20. Mutations in the immunoglobulin mu binding protein-2 (Ighmbp2) gene cause motor neuron disease and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) in the neuromuscular degeneration (nmd) mouse and spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress (SMARD1) in humans. To investigate the role of IGHMBP2 in the pathogenesis of DCM, we generated transgenic mice expressing the full-length Ighmbp2 cDNA specifically in myocytes under the control of the mouse titin promoter. This tissue-specific transgene increased the lifespan of nmd mice up to 8-fold by preventing primary DCM and showed complete functional correction as measured by ECG, echocardiography and plasma creatine kinase-MB. Double-transgenic nmd mice expressing Ighmbp2 both in myocytes and in neurons display correction of both DCM and motor neuron disease, resulting in an essentially wild-type appearance. Additionally, quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis was undertaken to identify genetic modifier loci responsible for the preservation of cardiac function and a marked delay in the onset of cardiomyopathy in a CAST/EiJ backcross population. Three major CAST-derived cardiac modifiers of nmd were identified on chromosomes 9, 10 and 16, which account for over 26% of the genetic variance and that continue to suppress the exacerbation of cardiomyopathy, otherwise resulting in early death, as incipient B6.CAST congenics. Overall, our results verify the tissue-specific requirement for IGHMBP2 in cardiomyocyte maintenance and survival and describe genetic modifiers that can alter the course of DCM through cardiac functional adaptation and physical remodeling in response to changes in load and respiratory demand.

Hum Mol Genet. 2005 Jul 1;14(13):1825-37. Epub 2005 May 11. Spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress type 1 (SMARD1) is a fatal autosomal recessive disorder seen in infants. It is characterized by lower motor neuron degeneration, progressive muscle paralysis and respiratory failure, for which no effective treatment exists. The phenotype of neuromuscular degeneration (nmd) mice closely resembles the human SMARD1. The identification of the mutated mouse gene in nmd mice, Ighmbp2, led to the discovery of mutations of the homologous gene in humans with SMARD1. We have studied the nmd mouse model with in vivo electrophysiological techniques and evaluated the efficacy of Mab2256, a monoclonal antibody with agonist effect on the tyrosine kinase receptor C, trkC, on disease progression in nmd mice. Treatment with Mab2256 resulted in a significant but transient improvement of muscle strength in nmd mice, as well as normalization of the neuromuscular depression during high-frequency nerve stimulation. These results suggest the potential of using monoclonal agonist antibodies for neurotrophin receptors in lower motor neuron diseases such as SMARD1.

Int J Biochem Cell Biol. 2002 Jun;34(6):699-707. Survival motor neuron (SMN) interacting protein 1 (SIP1) interacts with SMN protein and plays a crucial role in the biogenesis of spliceosomes. We have identified three novel splicing variants of the SIP1 (SIP1-beta, -gamma and -delta), in addition to the full-length SIP1-alpha. SIP1-alpha as found to be ubiquitously expressed at high levels in the various normal tissues examined. In contrast, SIP1-beta and -gamma were expressed at very low levels in these tissues. In muscle specimens from patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), the expression of SIP1-alpha was dramatically decreased compared to that observed in the normal tissues. In addition, the expression of SIP1-beta was significantly increased in tissues derived from patients with either disease. These findings suggest that an aberrant alternative splicing event in SIP1 occurs tissues derived from patients with the motor neuron diseases, and contributes to the pathological process of SMA and ALS.

Neuropathology. 2005 Dec;25(4):371-80. We have used adult rat peripheral nerve avulsion models to evaluate the effects of neuroprotective molecules on motoneuron degeneration. The right facial nerves of adult Fischer 344 male rats were avulsed and adenoviral vectors encoding glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), transforming growth factor-beta2 (TGFbeta2), and growth inhibitory factor (GIF) were injected into the facial canal. The treatment with the vectors significantly prevented the loss of lesioned facial motoneurons, improved choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) immunoreactivity and suppressed the induction of nitric oxide synthase activity in these neurons. In separate experiments, animals were orally administered a solution of a neuroprotective compound T-588 after avulsion. Both free oral administration and oral tube administration of T-588 improved the survival of injured motoneurons and ameliorated their ChAT immunoreactivity. These results indicate that the gene transfer of GDNF, BDNF, TGFbeta2, and GIF and oral administration of T-588 may prevent the degeneration of motoneurons in adult humans with motoneuron injury and motor neuron diseases.

Brain Res. 2002 Jul 19;944(1-2):195-9. We examined neuroprotective effects of recombinant adenoviral vectors encoding glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), cardiotrophin-1 (CT1), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1), and transforming growth factor-beta2 (TGFbeta2) on lesioned adult rat facial motoneurons. The right facial nerves of adult Fischer 344 male rats were avulsed and removed from the stylomastoid foramen, and adenoviral vectors were injected into the facial canal. Animals avulsed and treated with adenovirus encoding GDNF, BDNF, CNTF, CT1, IGF1 and TGFbeta2 showed intense immunolabeling for these factors in lesioned facial motoneurons, respectively, indicating adenoviral induction of the neurotrophic factors in these neurons. The treatment with adenovirus encoding GDNF, BDNF, or TGFbeta2 after avulsion significantly prevented the loss of lesioned facial motoneurons, improved choline acetyltransferase immunoreactivity and prevented the induction of nitric oxide synthase activity in these neurons. The treatment with adenovirus encoding CNTF, CT1 or IGF1, however, failed to protect these neurons after avulsion. These results indicate that the gene transfer of GDNF and BDNF and TGFbeta2 but not CNTF, CT1 or IGF1 may prevent the degeneration of motoneurons in adult humans with motoneuron injury and motor neuron diseases.

We compared the clinical and pharmacodynamic effects of N-terminal methionine brain-derived neurotrophic factor (met-BDNF) and endogenous met-free BDNF in wobbler mouse motor neuron disease (MND). Met- or met-free BDNF at 5 or 20 mg/kg was subcutaneously injected daily, six times/week for 4 weeks. At 20 mg/kg, grip strength (P BDNF; P BDNF) and running speed (P BDNF levels after the final injection were dose-dependent and did not differ between BDNF groups. Endogenous met-free BDNF exerts effects similar to met-BDNF in wobbler MND.

Amyotroph Lateral Scler Other Motor Neuron Disord. 2001 Mar;2(1):19-22. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is neuroprotective for motoneurons undergoing degeneration, including those in natural motor neuron disease (MND) in wobbler mice. To assess the role of BDNF in this model of MND, endogenous BDNF immunoreactivity was analyzed by semiquantitative video-image analysis. Affected cervical spinal cord motoneurons had significantly greater BDNF immunoreactivity compared to motoneurons of healthy littermates (P = 0.01) and affected lumbar spinal cord motoneurons (P = 0.008 at age 4 weeks; P = 0.005 at age 8 weeks). Neuronal nitric oxide synthase (n-NOS) immunocytochemistry revealed increased immunoreactivity in the affected cervical spinal cord motoneurons. Exogenous BDNF treatment partially inhibited the increased NOS activity, as quantitatively measured by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate diaphorase (NADPH-d) histochemistry. The mean number of NADPH-d (+) motoneurons in the cervical anterior horn decreased from 3.5 +/- 1.2 to 1.5 +/- 1.2 (P = 0.002). The increase in endogenous BDNF immunoreactivity in the affected spinal cord may be compensatory in diseased motoneurons, yet it appears to still be inadequate because exogenous BDNF treatment is required to suppress increased NOS activity in degenerating motoneurons. Our study indicates that BDNF is important in halting nitric oxide (NO)-mediated motor neuron degeneration, which has potential implications for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.

J Neurosci. 2006 Nov 1;26(44):11397-402. An increase in the expression of the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) has been observed in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and in the mice models of the disease. TNF-alpha is a potent activator of macrophages and microglia and, under certain conditions, can induce or exacerbate neuronal cell death. Here, we assessed the contribution of TNF-alpha in motor neuron disease in mice overexpressing mutant superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) genes linked to familial ALS. This was accomplished by the generation of mice expressing SOD1 (G37R) or SOD1 (G93A) mutants in the context of TNF-alpha gene knock out. Surprisingly, the absence of TNF-alpha did not affect the lifespan or the extent of motor neuron loss in SOD1 transgenic mice. These results provide compelling evidence indicating that TNF-alpha does not directly contribute to motor neuron degeneration caused by SOD1 mutations.

Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various central nervous system diseases with an inflammatory component. Elevated TNF levels were observed in animal models of motor neuron disease (MND), and activation of the TNF system has been reported in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The easy availability of scientific reports to the layman through the web, often based only on the abstracts, has prompted many patients to ask whether anti-TNF therapy might be beneficial in ALS. This review discusses the possible role of TNF in motoneuronal degeneration. Although TNF is mostly regarded as neurotoxic cytokine, there are reports of a neuroprotective and neurotrophic action. Studies with animal models of ALS are not sufficient to show whether TNF has a pathogenic or a protective role in MND though anti-TNF antibodies have shown protective effects in experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS). On the other hand, while TNF-deficient mice are protected from EAE, anti-TNF antibodies worsen the disease in MS patients, suggesting caution in extrapolating preliminary basic studies to the patient.
motor_neuron_disease	cystathionine-gamma-lyase	Negative	PMID:17095121	Diwakar L, Ravindranath V: Inhibition of cystathionine-gamma-lyase leads to loss of glutathione and aggravation of mitochondrial dysfunction mediated by excitatory amino acid in the CNS. Neurochem Int. 2007 Jan;50(2):418-26. Epub 2006 Nov 13. Oxidative stress has been implicated in the pathogenesis and progression of neurodegenerative disorders and antioxidants potentially have a major role in neuroprotection. Optimum levels of glutathione (gamma-glutamylcysteinyl glycine), an endogenous thiol antioxidant are required for the maintenance of the redox status of cells. Cystathionine gamma-lyase is the rate-limiting enzyme for the synthesis of cysteine from methionine and availability of cysteine is a critical factor in glutathione synthesis. In the present study, we have examined the role of cystathionine gamma-lyase in maintaining the redox homeostasis in brain, particularly with reference to mitochondrial function since the complex I of the electron transport chain is sensitive to redox perturbation. Inhibition of cystathionine gamma-lyase by l-propargylglycine caused loss of glutathione and decrease in complex I activity in the brain although the enzyme activity in mouse brain was 1% of the corresponding hepatic activity. We then examined the effect of this inhibition on the neurotoxicity mediated by the excitatory amino acid, l-beta-oxalyl amino-l-alanine, which is the causative factor of a type of motor neuron disease, neurolathyrism. l-beta-Oxalyl amino-l-alanine toxicity was exacerbated by l-propargylglycine measured as loss of complex I activity indicating the importance of cystathionine gamma-lyase in maintaining glutathione levels and in turn the mitochondrial function during excitotoxicity. Oxidative stress generated by l-beta-oxalyl amino-l-alanine itself inhibited cystathionine gamma-lyase, which could be prevented by prior treatment with thiol antioxidant. Thus, cystathionine gamma-lyase itself is susceptible to inactivation by oxidative stress and this can potentially exacerbate oxidant-induced damage. Cystathionine gamma-lyase is present in neuronal cells in human brain and its activity is several-fold higher compared to mouse brain. It could potentially play an important role in maintaining glutathione and protein thiol homeostasis in brain and hence afford neuroprotection.
motor_neuron_disease	Spastin	Negative	PMID:15079007	Molon A, Di Giovanni S, Chen YW, Clarkson PM, Angelini C, Pegoraro E, Hoffman EP: Large-scale disruption of microtubule pathways in morphologically normal human spastin muscle. Neurology. 2004 Apr 13;62(7):1097-104. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the molecular pathways disrupted by dominant spastin mutations in apparently unaffected skeletal muscle from patients with motor neuron disease (SPG4). METHODS: The authors studied muscle of three individuals from two unrelated families affected by spastic paraplegia caused by spastin mutations. The authors compared RNA expression profiles to 7 normal and 13 pathologic muscle U95A profiles (Duchenne dystrophy, acute quadriplegic myopathy, and spinal muscular atrophy). Data were validated with U133A arrays with seven different control specimens. mRNA and protein confirmations were done for a subset of genes. RESULTS: Both nonsense and missense mutations in the spastin gene disrupted microtubule pathways in nonpathologic tissue, including microtubule dynamics, stability, exocytosis, and endocytosis. CONCLUSIONS: Normal muscle can be used to uncover biochemical perturbation in motor neuron disease. Altered microtubule metabolism in SPG4-linked hereditary spastic paraplegia patients leads to pathology of the long descending tracks of motor neurons that likely have a stringent need for efficient microtubular transport. As many inherited neurologic conditions show a systemic biochemical defect with disease limited to neurons, our data have broader implications for biochemical pathway studies of many neurologic disorders.
motor_neuron_disease	Spastin	Negative	PMID:14506940	McDermott CJ, Roberts D, Tomkins J, Bushby KM, Shaw PJ: Spastin and paraplegin gene analysis in selected cases of motor neurone disease (MND). Amyotroph Lateral Scler Other Motor Neuron Disord. 2003 Jun;4(2):96-9. Mutations in both the spastin and paraplegin genes have been associated with upper motor neurone degeneration in hereditary spastic paraparesis. The aim of this study was to investigate if mutation in these genes is associated with upper motor neurone degeneration in primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) or selected motor neurone disease (MND) cases. DNA was extracted from whole blood and screened using single stranded conformation polymorphism and heteroduplex analysis. No mutation in the spastin or paraplegin genes was identified in the PLS or MND cases. Polymorphism was identified in the paraplegin gene but no association was shown with PLS or MND. We therefore conclude that mutation in spastin and paraplegin genes does not appear to cause PLS or MND.
motor_neuron_disease	Metallothionein	Positive	PMID:17114818	Ono S, Endo Y, Tokuda E, Ishige K, Tabata K, Asami S, Ito Y, Suzuki T: Upregulation of metallothionein-I mRNA expression in a rodent model for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Biol Trace Elem Res. 2006 Oct;113(1):93-104. Metallothionein (MT) mRNA expression was investigated in a rodent model (G93A SOD1 transgenic mouse) for a lethal motor neuron disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In 8-wk-old mice that did not yet exhibit motor paralysis, MT-I mRNA expression was already significantly upregulated in the region of the spinal cord responsible for motor paralysis. The expression of another isoform, MT-III, was not changed. In the cerebellum, which is not responsible for motor paralysis in ALS, neither the expression profiles of MT-I nor MT-III were altered. In 16-wk-old mice exhibiting motor paralysis, the expression of MT-I mRNA remained upregulated and the MT-III level tended to be elevated. Although no significant differences were found in the levels of both isoforms in the liver or kidney of 8-wk-old mice, the MT-I mRNA expression level was significantly upregulated in the kidney and liver of 16-wk-old mice. These results indicated that the MT-I isoform, but not the MT-III isoform, is associated with motor neuron death in ALS and suggested that the disease might be a systemic disorder to which the spinal cord is particularly susceptible.

Genetika. 2006 Jan;42(1):104-9. Polymorphisms of the genes of the glutamatergic system EAAT2, GRIA1, and GRIA2 have been analyzed in patients with sporadic motor neuron disease (MND) from Russia. The disease is not associated with polymorphic alleles of the genes studied, which indicates that EAAT2, GRIA1, and GRIA2 play an insignificant role in the pathogenesis of sporadic MND.

Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2003 Apr 15;100(8):4790-5. Epub 2003 Mar 31. Therapeutic vaccination with Copaxone (glatiramer acetate, Cop-1) protects motor neurons against acute and chronic degenerative conditions. In acute degeneration after facial nerve axotomy, the number of surviving motor neurons was almost two times higher in Cop-1-vaccinated mice than in nonvaccinated mice, or in mice injected with PBS emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant (P gene Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase G93A (SOD1), and therefore simulate the chronic human motor neuron disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Cop-1 vaccination prolonged life span compared to untreated matched controls, from 211 +/- 7 days (n = 15) to 263 +/- 8 days (n = 14; P activity. In line with the experimentally based concept of protective autoimmunity, these findings suggest that Cop-1 vaccination boosts the local immune response needed to combat destructive self-compounds associated with motor neuron death. Its differential action in CNS autoimmune diseases and neurodegenerative disorders, depending on the regimen used, allows its use as a therapy for either condition. Daily administration of Cop-1 is an approved treatment for multiple sclerosis. The protocol for non-autoimmune neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, remains to be established by future studies.

Am J Pathol. 2007 Jul;171(1):227-40. TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) is a major pathological protein of sporadic and familial frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin-positive, tau-negative inclusions (FTLD-U) with or without motor neuron disease (MND). Thus, TDP-43 defines a novel class of neurodegenerative diseases called TDP-43 proteinopathies. We performed ubiquitin and TDP-43 immunohistochemistry on 193 cases of familial and sporadic FTLD with or without MND. On selected cases, immunoelectron microscopy and biochemistry were performed. Clinically defined frontotemporal dementias (FTDs) included four groups: 1) familial FTD with mutations in progranulin (n = 36), valosin-containing protein (n = 5), charged multivesicular body protein 2B (n = 4), and linked to chromosome 9p (n = 7); 2) familial cases of FTD with unknown gene association (n = 29); 3) sporadic FTD (n = 72); and 4) familial and sporadic FTD with MND (n = 40). Our studies confirm that the spectrum of TDP-43 proteinopathies includes most cases of sporadic and familial FTLD-U with and without MND and expand this disease spectrum to include reported families with FTD linked to chromosome 9p but not FTD with charged multivesicular body protein 2B mutations. Thus, despite significant clinical, genetic, and neuropathological heterogeneity of FTLD-U, TDP-43 is a common pathological substrate underlying a large subset of these disorders, thereby implicating TDP-43 in novel and unifying mechanisms of FTLD pathogenesis.

Acta Neuropathol. 2007 Jul;114(1):63-70. Epub 2007 May 10. The rapid confirmation of the initial report by Neumann et al. (Science 314:130-133, 2006) that transactive response (TAR)-DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) is the major disease protein linking frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin-positive inclusions (FTLD-U) with and without motor neuron disease (MND) as well as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) implies that TDP-43 proteinopathy underlies major forms of sporadic as well as familial FTLD and ALS. Not only was the identity of the ubiquitinated proteins that accumulate in neurons and glia of these disorders finally resolved, but it also was shown that pathologic TDP-43 was hyperphosphorylated, ubiquitinated and cleaved to generate C-terminal fragments in affected brain and spinal cord of FTLD-U and ALS. This review summarizes the growing evidence that TDP-43 proteinopathy is the common pathologic substrate linking FTLD and ALS, and it considers the implications of these findings for developing better strategies to diagnose and treat these neurodegenerative disorders.

Brain. 2007 May;130(Pt 5):1375-85. Epub 2007 Mar 14. Frontotemporal dementia is accompanied by motor neuron disease (FTD + MND) in approximately 10% of cases. There is accumulating evidence for a clinicopathological overlap between FTD and MND based on observations of familial aggregation and neuropathological findings of ubiquitin-positive neuronal cytoplasmatic inclusions (NCI) in lower motor neurons, hippocampus and neocortex in both conditions. Several familial forms exist with different genetic loci and defects. We investigated the familial aggregation and clinical presentation of FTD + MND cases in a large cohort of 368 FTD patients in The Netherlands. Immunohistochemistry of available brain tissue of deceased patients was investigated using a panel of antibodies including ubiquitin, p62 and TAR DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa antibodies. A total of eight patients coming from six families had a family history positive for FTD + MND (mean age at onset 53.2 +/- 8.4 years). Five patients presented with behavioural changes and cognitive changes followed by motor neuron disease, whereas symptoms of motor neuron disease were the presenting features in the remaining three patients. Other affected relatives in these families showed dementia/FTD, MND or FTD + MND reflecting the clinical interfamilial variation. No mutations were identified in any of the candidate genes, including Superoxide Dismutase 1, dynactin, angiogenin, Microtubule-Associated Protein Tau, valosin-containing protein and progranulin. Available brain tissue of five patients with familial FTD + MND showed NCI in hippocampus, neocortex and spinal cord in all, and neuronal intranuclear inclusions (NII) in two brains. TDP-43 antibody showed robust staining of neuronal inclusions similar in distribution and morphology to NCI and NII. Additionally, TDP-43 antibody also stained ubiquitin-negative glial inclusions in the basal striatum of one case. In conclusion, there exists considerable clinical variation within families with FTD + MND, which may be determined by other genetic or environmental factors. NII are also found in some cases of familial FTD + MND without Progranulin mutations. The observation of glial TDP-43 positive inclusions in one brain is very interesting, although their pathophysiological significance is yet unknown.

Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2006 Jun 20;103(25):9595-600. Epub 2006 Jun 12. ALS2 is an autosomal recessive form of spastic paraparesis (motor neuron disease) with juvenile onset and slow progression caused by loss of function of alsin, an activator of Rac1 and Rab5 small GTPases. To establish an animal model of ALS2 and derive insights into the pathogenesis of this illness, we have generated alsin-null mice. Cytosol from brains of Als2 (-/-) mice shows marked diminution of Rab5-dependent endosome fusion activity. Furthermore, primary neurons from Als2 (-/-) mice show a disturbance in endosomal transport of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) and BDNF receptors, whereas neuronal viability and endocytosis of transferrin and dextran seem unaltered. There is a significant decrease in the size of cortical motor neurons, and Als2 (-/-) mice are mildly hypoactive. Altered trophic receptor trafficking in neurons of Als2 (-/-) mice may underlie the histopathological and behavioral changes observed and the pathogenesis of ALS2.

Genetika. 2002 Nov;38(11):1566-8. Comparison of the frequency distributions of alleles, genotypes, and genotype combinations of genes GSTM1 and GSTT1 did not show statistically significant differences between patients with motor neuron disease (MND) and a random sample from the Moscow population. Apparently, these genes are not involved in MND pathogenesis in these patients.

J Hum Nutr Diet. 2007 Feb;20(1):3-13. BACKGROUND: The management of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neurone disease (ALS/MND) has shifted from an attitude of nihilism to treatments that prolong survival and offer hope. Nutrition is an integral component of ALS/MND care requiring coordination among acute and community multi-disciplinary teams (MDT). Evidence-based nutrition guidelines exist for this patient group but their use among dietitians is unknown. The aim of this study was to survey the knowledge, practice and guideline use of dietitians working in ALS/MND centres/clinics across England, Wales, Northern Ireland (EWNI) and Canada. METHOD: Dietetic contact details were obtained from the Motor Neurone Disease Association (MNDA) and the ALS Society of Canada (ALSSC) websites. Telephone interviews were conducted with 23 dietitians using a standardized questionnaire. RESULTS: Multi-disciplinary team membership was high (78%). Only 22% dietitians had > 4-years experience in ALS/MND care. Dietitians reported using body weight, percentage weight loss (PWL) and body mass index (BMI) to assess nutritional status. Equations used to estimate energy and protein requirements differed. Most frequent dietary advice was high calorie, texture modification and prescription nutritional supplements. Artificial nutrition and hydration (ANH) was discussed when patients developed dysphagia, energy intake was inadequate, weight loss of 10% or forced vital capacity (FVC) was reduced. A percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) service was available at all clinics/centres. CONCLUSION: Nutritional assessment techniques and dietary advice should be standardized. Dietetic collaboration at national and international level is recommended to reduce professional isolation. Training and support in ALS/MND nutrition should be made available as part of post-dietetic registration. Further dietetic research is required to stimulate nutritional care.
motor_neuron_disease	Thy1	Negative	PMID:12077179	Lino MM, Schneider C, Caroni P: Accumulation of SOD1 mutants in postnatal motoneurons does not cause motoneuron pathology or motoneuron disease. J Neurosci. 2002 Jun 15;22(12):4825-32. Transgenic mice expressing high levels of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FALS)-associated mutant superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) under the control of a human SOD1 minigene (hMg) accumulate mutant protein ubiquitously and develop motoneuron disease. However, restricted expression of SOD1 mutants in neurons apparently does not cause motor impairments in mice. Here, we investigated the possible pathogenic roles of mutant SOD1 accumulation in motoneurons. First, we used a Thy1 expression cassette to drive high constitutive expression of transgene in postnatal mouse neurons, including upper and lower motoneurons. Second, we expressed human (h) SOD1 (G93A) and hSOD1 (G85R) as transgenes (i.e., two SOD1 mutants with aggressive pathogenic properties in inducing FALS). Third, in addition to clinical signs of disease, we monitored early signs of disease onset and pathogenesis, including muscle innervation, astrogliosis in the spinal cord, and accumulation of ubiquitinated deposits in motoneurons and astrocytes. We report that high-level expression and accumulation of the mutant proteins in neurons failed to produce any detectable sign of pathology or disease in these transgenic mice. Crossing hMg-SOD1 (G93A) mice (Gurney et al., 1994) with Thy1-SOD1 (G93A) mice produced double-transgenic mice with spinal cord SOD1 (G93A) levels that were approximately twofold higher than in the hMg-SOD1 (G93A) single transgenics but did not affect the onset or progression of pathology or motoneuron disease. The accumulation of mutant SOD1 in postnatal motoneurons is thus not sufficient and probably also not critical to induce or accelerate motoneuron disease in FALS mice. The pathogenic process in FALS may involve non-neuronal cells, and selective vulnerability of motoneurons to this process may lead to motoneuron pathology and disease.

J Neurol Sci. 2006 Feb 15;241(1-2):39-43. Epub 2005 Nov 21. We evaluated the specific IgG antibodies against heat shock proteins (HSPs) in cerebrospinal fluids (CSF) from patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). ELISA was employed to examine IgG antibodies against ten HSPs (HSP27, alphaA and alphaB crystallins, HSP60, CCT, Mycobacterium bovis HSP65, Escherichia coli GroEL, HSP70, HSC70 and HSP90) in CSF from 30 patients with MS, and 25 patients with motor neuron diseases (MND). Significantly higher antibody titers against HSP70 and HSC70 proteins were found in CSF obtained from patients with MS as compared with MND independent of CSF total protein, IgG concentrations and IgG indices, respectively. The antibody titers against HSP70 were indicated to be significantly higher in the progressive cases than in cases of remission. The results suggest that IgG antibodies against specific types of HSPs especially HSP70 family proteins (HSP70 and HSC70) in CSF may play an important role in the pathophysiology of MS through the modification of immune response and cytoprotective functions of molecular chaperons.

J Neuroimmunol. 2004 Nov;156(1-2):204-9. We examined antibodies against 10 heat shock proteins (HSPs) in cerebrospinal fluids (CSF) and sera from patients with Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS). Significantly higher IgG antibody titers against HSP27, HSP60, HSP70 and HSP90 family, including mycobacterial HSP65 and Escherichia coli GroEL, were found in CSF from GBS patients as compared with motor neuron disease. Serum IgG antibodies against each HSP showed no difference between GBS patients and normal controls. GBS seems to be induced by reactive autoimmune responses frequently triggered by infections. The CSF antibodies against HSPs may modify the immune responses and/or cell-protective functions of HSPs in the pathophysiology of GBS.
motor_neuron_disease	superoxide-dismutase	Positive	PMID:16737688	Leichsenring A, Linnartz B, Zhu XR, Lubbert H, Stichel CC: Ascending neuropathology in the CNS of a mutant SOD1 mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Neurobiol Dis. 2000 Dec;7(6 Pt B):623-43. Transgenic mice expressing a mutated human Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) gene develop a motor neuron disease similar to familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FALS). While the histopathology and the inflammatory reactions in the spinal cord of these mice are well described, their spatiotemporal extension into brain areas and the relationship between degenerative and inflammatory events remain obscure. In the present study, we investigated the time course and extent of degenerative changes and inflammatory reactions in the CNS during progression of the disease in a transgenic FALS model, the SOD1-G93A mouse with histological and immunohistochemical methods. Compared to non-transgenic littermates, the SOD1-G93A transgenics developed widespread degeneration in both motor and extra-motor regions up to telencephalic regions, including the cerebral cortex but sparing distinct regions like the striatum and hippocampus. We provide evidence that these degenerative processes are accompanied by intense inflammatory reactions in the brain, which spatiotemporally correlate with degeneration and comprise besides strong astro- and microgliotic reactions also an influx of peripheral immune cells such as T-lymphocytes and dendritic cells. Both degeneration and inflammatory reactions spread caudocranially, starting at 2 months in the spinal cord and reaching the telencephalon at 5 months of age. Since the corticospinal tract lacked any signs of degeneration, we conclude that the upper and the lower motor neurons degenerate independently of each other.
motor_neuron_disease	superoxide-dismutase	Positive	PMID:16184763	Batulan Z, Nalbantoglu J, Durham HD: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs differentially affect the heat shock response in cultured spinal cord cells. Neuromuscul Disord. 2007 Jul 9;. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been shown to amplify the heat shock response in cell lines by increasing the binding of heat shock transcription factor-1 to heat shock elements within heat shock gene promoters. Because overexpression of the inducible heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) was neuroprotective in a culture model of motor neuron disease, this study investigated whether NSAIDs induce Hsp70 and confer cytoprotection in motor neurons of dissociated spinal cord cultures exposed to various stresses. Two NSAIDs, sodium salicylate and niflumic acid, lowered the temperature threshold for induction of Hsp70 in glia but failed to do so in motor neurons. At concentrations that increased Hsp70 in heat shocked glial cells, sodium salicylate failed to delay death of motor neurons exposed to hyperthermia, paraquat-mediated oxidative stress, and glutamate excitotoxicity. Neither sodium salicylate nor the cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, niflumic acid, protected motor neurons from the toxicity of mutated Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD-1) linked to a familial form of the motor neuron disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Thus, treatment with 2 types of NSAIDs failed to overcome the high threshold for the activation of heat shock response in motor neurons.
motor_neuron_disease	superoxide-dismutase	Positive	PMID:15773754	Julien JP, Millecamps S, Kriz J: Cytoskeletal defects in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (motor neuron disease). Novartis Found Symp. 2005;264:183-92; discussion 192-6 There is growing evidence for the involvement of cytoskeletal defects in the pathogenesis of motor neuron disease and especially in components of the microtubule-based transport system. Here we will review our recent work aiming to elucidate the role of peripherin in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and to address the mechanism of disease caused by deletions in the ALS2 gene that cause recessive forms of juvenile ALS and primary lateral sclerosis (PLS). Peripherin is an intermediate filament protein detected in spheroids, a hallmark of ALS, and increased levels of peripherin mRNA have been found in some ALS cases. Our transgenic mouse and cell culture studies support the view of a peripherin involvement in ALS. However, a gene knockout approach demonstrated that peripherin is not a key contributor of motor neuron disease caused by mutant superoxide dismutase linked to familial ALS. A recent breakthrough in the field of ALS came with the discovery of frameshift deletions in the ALS2 gene coding for Alsin. Our transfection experiments in cultured cells suggest that Alsin is a cytoskeletal protein with dual endosomal and centrosomal localizations. We have generated a mouse knockout for Alsin that develops progressive motor dysfunction during ageing. Thus, it is anticipated that this mouse model will be useful to investigate the pathogenic pathways linked to Alsin gene mutations.

Ann N Y Acad Sci. 2003 Dec;1010:552-6. Familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FALS) is a fatal motor neuron disease that is caused by mutations in the gene encoding superoxide dismutase-type 1 (SOD1). The affected regions of the FALS brain are characterized by aggregated SOD1, and the mutations that destabilize SOD1 appear to promote its aggregation in vitro. Because dissociation of the native SOD1 dimer is required for its in vitro aggregation, we initiated an in silico screening program to find drug-like molecules that would stabilize the SOD1 dimer. A potential binding site for such molecules at the SOD1 dimer interface was identified, and its importance was validated by mutagenesis. About 1.5 million molecules from commercial databases were docked at the dimer interface. Of the 100 molecules with the highest predicted binding affinity, 15 significantly inhibited in vitro aggregation and denaturation of A4V, a FALS-linked variant of SOD1. In the presence of several of these molecules, A4V and other FALS-linked SOD1 mutants such as G93A and G85R behaved similarly to wild-type SOD1, suggesting that these compounds could be leads toward effective therapeutics against FALS.

Neurobiol Aging. 2006 Sep 11;. More than 90 point mutations in human CuZn superoxide dismutase lead to the development of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, known also as motor neuron disease. A growing body of evidence suggests that a subset of mutations located close to the dimeric interface can lead to a major destabilization of the mutant enzymes. We have determined the crystal structures of the Ala4Val (A4V) and Ile113Thr (I113T) mutants to 1.9 and 1.6 A, respectively. In the A4V structure, small changes at the dimer interface result in a substantial reorientation of the two monomers. This effect is also seen in the case of the I113T crystal structure, but to a smaller extent. X-ray solution scattering data show that in the solution state, both of the mutants undergo a more pronounced conformational change compared with wild-type superoxide dismutase (SOD) than that observed in the A4V crystal structure. Shape reconstructions from the x-ray scattering data illustrate the nature of this destabilization. Comparison of these scattering data with those for bovine CuZn SOD measured at different temperatures shows that an analogous change in the scattering profile occurs for the bovine enzyme in the temperature range of 70-80 degrees C. These results demonstrate that the A4V and I113T mutants are substantially destabilized in comparison with wild-type SOD1, and it is possible that the pathogenic properties of this subset of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis mutants are at least in part due to this destabilization.

Brain. 2002 Apr;125(Pt 4):722-31. Fifty-one blood samples of Russian patients with sporadic motor neuron disease were examined for mutations in Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD-1) gene. One female patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) was heterozygous for G12R mutation. This patient suffered from ALS with cervical cord onset, pyramidal variant and fast progression. Mutation was also detected in her healthy son. Earlier, such mutation was described in 5 Italian patients with slow progressive ALS. Also, D90A SOD-1 gene associated haplotypes of the female ALS patients previously examined by the authors have been analyzed. A homozygous female patient with ALS was characterized by typical lumbar onset and extremely slow progression, as well as a female patient with heterozygous mutation and moderate progression carried so-called "Scandinavian" haplotype. To our knowledge, it is the first report on the finding of the haplotype considered as a "protective" one in the subjects heterozygous for D90A mutation with clinical symptoms of ALS. Mechanisms of "protective" influence of this haplotype on ALS course are not yet elucidated. Our finding suggests that the presence of "Scandinavian" haplotype does not completely protect from the disease development in patients exposed to other more pathogenic causative factors. This assumption is in line with modern conceptions on motor neuron disease as a complicated multifactor disorder.
motor_neuron_disease	superoxide-dismutase	Positive	PMID:12828939	Lariviere RC, Beaulieu JM, Nguyen MD, Julien JP: Peripherin is not a contributing factor to motor neuron disease in a mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis caused by mutant superoxide dismutase. Mol Med. 2000 May;6(5):410-29. Peripherin is a type III intermediate filament protein detected in axonal spheroids associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The overexpression of peripherin induces degeneration of spinal motor neurons during aging in transgenic mice and in cultured neuronal cells derived from peripherin transgenic embryos. Here, we investigated whether peripherin is a contributor of pathogenesis in mice overexpressing a mutant superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1 (G37R)) gene linked to familial ALS. This was done by the generation and analysis of SOD1 (G37R) mice that either overexpress a peripherin transgene (G37R;TgPer mice) or lack the endogenous peripherin gene (G37R;Per-/- mice). Surprisingly, upregulation or suppression of peripherin expression had no effects on disease onset, mortality, and loss of motor neurons in SOD1 (G37R) mice. These results provide compelling evidence that peripherin is not a key contributor of motor neuron degeneration associated with toxicity of mutant SOD1.
motor_neuron_disease	superoxide-dismutase	Positive	PMID:12165567	Kirby J, Menzies FM, Cookson MR, Bushby K, Shaw PJ: Differential gene expression in a cell culture model of SOD1-related familial motor neurone disease. Zh Nevrol Psikhiatr Im S S Korsakova. 2003;103(11):46-52. Motor neurone disease is caused by mutations in Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) in 15-20% of familial cases, due to a toxic gain of function by the mutant enzyme. However, the underlying mechanism of SOD1-mediated neurodegeneration remains uncertain. By investigating alterations in gene expression in the presence of mutant Cu/Zn SOD, we aimed to identify pathways that contribute to motor neurone injury and cell death. Using a cellular model of familial motor neurone disease, the motor neuronal cell line NSC34 was stably transfected with either normal or mutant (G37R, G93A, I113T) SOD1 cDNAs, and the effect of the presence of these proteins on gene expression was analysed. This model allowed gene expression changes to be studied specifically in cells with a motor neurone phenotype, without interference from genes expressed by glia, astrocytes and other cell types located in the central nervous system. Using a commercially available cDNA membrane array, we investigated the expression levels of 588 genes from key biological pathways. Gene expression was studied in the cells under both basal culture conditions and following oxidative stress induced by serum withdrawal. Twenty-nine differentially expressed genes were identified, 7 of which were specifically downregulated in the presence of the mutant Cu/Zn SOD protein, and whose expression was further studied by real-time PCR. Presence of the mutant Cu/Zn SOD was confirmed to lead to a decrease in expression of KIF3B, a kinesin-like protein, which forms part of the KIF3 molecular motor. c-Fes, thought to be involved in intracellular vesicle transport was also decreased, further implicating the involvement of vesicular trafficking as a mode of action for mutant Cu/Zn SOD. In addition, a decrease was confirmed in ICAM1, a response in part due to the increased expression of SOD1, and decreased Bag1 expression was confirmed in two of the three mutant cell lines, providing further support for the involvement of apoptosis in SOD1-associated motor neurone death.
motor_neuron_disease	superoxide-dismutase	Positive	PMID:11717358	Nagai M, Aoki M, Miyoshi I, Kato M, Pasinelli P, Kasai N, Brown RH Jr, Itoyama Y: Rats expressing human cytosolic copper-zinc superoxide dismutase transgenes with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: associated mutations develop motor neuron disease. Am J Med Genet A. 2004 Sep 1;129(3):248-53. Some cases of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are caused by mutations in the gene encoding cytosolic, copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1). We report here that rats that express a human SOD1 transgene with two different ALS-associated mutations (G93A and H46R) develop striking motor neuron degeneration and paralysis. As in the human disease and transgenic ALS mice, pathological analysis demonstrates selective loss of motor neurons in the spinal cords of these transgenic rats. In spinal cord tissues, this is accompanied by activation of apoptotic genes known to be activated by mutant SOD1 protein in vitro and in vivo. These animals provide additional support for the proposition that motor neuron death in SOD1-related ALS reflects one or more acquired, neurotoxic properties of the mutant SOD1 protein. The larger size of this rat model as compared with the ALS mice will facilitate studies involving manipulations of spinal fluid (implantation of intrathecal catheters for chronic therapeutic studies; CSF sampling) and spinal cord (e.g., direct administration of viral- and cell-mediated therapies).
motor_neuron_disease	superoxide-dismutase	Positive	PMID:11290408	Williams RE, Cookson MR, Fray AE, Manning PM, Menzies FM, Figlewicz DA, Shaw PJ: Cultured glial cells are resistant to the effects of motor neurone disease-associated SOD1 mutations. Neurosci Lett. 2001 Apr 20;302(2-3):146-50. Free radical damage has been implicated in the pathophysiology of motor neurone disease (MND); mutations have been identified in the gene encoding Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1). There is evidence that glial cell dysfunction may contribute to motor neurone injury, but the exact role of glial cells in MND has yet to be established. The aim of this study was to determine whether expression of mutant SOD1 affects the response of glia to oxidative stress. Stable C6 glioma cells expressing mutant SOD1 and cortical astrocyte cultures from G93A-SOD1 transgenic mice were exposed to: xanthine/xanthine oxidase; hydrogen peroxide; A23187 and 3-morpholinosydonimine. Cell viability was measured using the 3-(4,5-dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Neither C6 glioma cells nor cortical astrocytes expressing mutant SOD1 were more susceptible to any of the free radical generating systems compared to control cells. These results suggest that astrocytes are resistant to the toxic effects of mutant SOD1 widely reported for neuronal cells.

Genetika. 2006 Jan;42(1):104-9. Polymorphisms of the genes of the glutamatergic system EAAT2, GRIA1, and GRIA2 have been analyzed in patients with sporadic motor neuron disease (MND) from Russia. The disease is not associated with polymorphic alleles of the genes studied, which indicates that EAAT2, GRIA1, and GRIA2 play an insignificant role in the pathogenesis of sporadic MND.
motor_neuron_disease	GLT-1	Positive	PMID:12752781	Legay V, Deleage C, Beaulieux F, Giraudon P, Aymard M, Lina B: Impaired glutamate uptake and EAAT2 downregulation in an enterovirus chronically infected human glial cell line. Eur J Neurosci. 2003 May;17(9):1820-8. Rapid and efficient uptake of glutamate via the high-affinity glutamate transporter EAAT2 is important for limiting glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity involved in neuronal death. Furthermore, there is evidence of altered glutamate uptake and catabolism in motor neuron diseases. Such a defect has been reported in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, the major motor neuron disease, and was associated with impairment in EAAT2 processing. We recently reported the presence of enterovirus genome specifically in the anterior horn of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis cases, suggesting the involvement of a chronic/persistent enterovirus infection in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. To investigate a putative link between enterovirus infection and the glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity observed in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, we developed an in vitro model consisting of a human glial cell line infected with ECHOvirus 6, one of the enteroviruses with sequences closely related to those detected in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In these glial cells, an ECHOvirus 6 chronic infection was established, resulting in altered extracellular glutamate uptake. This correlated with an aberrant splicing of the EAAT2 pre-messenger ribonucleic acid and a significant loss of EAAT2 protein expression, similar to that observed in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. These results provide convincing evidence that an enterovirus chronic/persistent infection may alter glial glutamate uptake and catabolism. As enteroviruses are extremely common human pathogens, they may act as a trigger in the development of certain motor neuron diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

J Neurochem. 2002 Aug;82(3):594-603. Glutamate-mediated neurotoxicity and a reduced expression of the excitatory amino acid transporter 2 (EAAT2) have been described in the pathogenesis of several acute and chronic neurological conditions. EAAT2 is the major carrier of glutamate in the mammalian brain. However, the principles of EAAT2 expression regulation are not fully understood. For the human brain, extensive alternative splicing of the EAAT2 RNA has been shown. To delineate the complex RNA regulation of EAAT2 we investigated whether the murine species is a suitable model for the study of EAAT2 splicing events. We identified five splice variants (mEAAT2/5UT1-5) encoding different 5'-untranslated sequences and two distinct N-termini of the putative EAAT2 polypeptide. In the murine CNS we found a region-specific expression pattern of the novel 5'-variants of EAAT2 as shown by in situ hybridization, dot blotting and competitive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Furthermore, we performed an expression analysis of the EAAT2 splice variants in the spinal cord of a transgenic model (SOD1G93A) of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a motor neurone disease for which altered splicing of EAAT2 has been discussed. We found an increased expression of mEAAT2/5UT4 and a reduction of mEAAT2/5UT5 in the early course of the disease. We conclude that alternative splicing of 5'-sequences may contribute to the regional expression of the EAAT2 RNA and was altered in the pre-symptomatic stage of the SOD1G93A-mouse model for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
motor_neuron_disease	GLT-1	Positive	PMID:11784698	Banner SJ, Fray AE, Ince PG, Steward M, Cookson MR, Shaw PJ: The expression of the glutamate re-uptake transporter excitatory amino acid transporter 1 (EAAT1) in the normal human CNS and in motor neurone disease: an immunohistochemical study. Neuroscience. 2002;109(1):27-44. A monoclonal antibody to excitatory amino acid transporter 1 (EAAT1) has been generated which robustly stains paraffin-embedded, formaldehyde-fixed as well as snap-frozen human post-mortem brain tissue. We have used this antibody to map the distribution of EAAT1 throughout normal human CNS tissue. In addition this antibody has been used to perform a semi-quantitative immunohistochemical analysis of the expression of EAAT1 in motor cortex and cervical cord tissue taken from motor neurone disease cases (n=17) and neurologically normal controls (n=12). By comparing the relative optical density measurements of identical regions of motor cortex and cervical spinal cord an increase in the expression levels of EAAT1 was observed in motor neurone disease tissue compared to the control tissue and in both motor cortex and cervical spinal cord (9-17% and 13-33% increases respectively). EAAT1 was observed to be the most abundant transporter in more "caudal" brain regions such as the diencephalon and brainstem and its expression in other regions was frequently more uniform than that of EAAT2. In the motor cortex, EAAT1 immunoreactivity was present in all grey matter laminae, with some staining of individual astrocytes in the white matter. In spinal cord, EAAT1 immunoreactivity was strongest in the substantia gelatinosa. In the ventral horn, motor neurones were surrounded with a dense rim of perisomatic EAAT1 immunoreactivity, and the neuropil showed diffuse staining. Additional studies using double-labelling immunocytochemistry demonstrated that astrocytic co-localisation of EAAT1 and EAAT2 may occasionally be seen, but was not widespread in the human CNS and that in general astrocytes were positive for either EAAT1 or EAAT2.These results demonstrate that the EAAT1 has a widespread abundance throughout all regions of the human CNS examined and that there exist discrete populations of astrocytes that are positive solely for either EAAT1 or EAAT2. Furthermore, there is evidence to suggest that altered EAAT1 expression in motor neurone disease follows a different pattern to the reported changes of EAAT2 expression in this condition, indicating that the role of glutamate transporters in the pathogenesis of motor neurone disease appears more complex than previously appreciated.
motor_neuron_disease	huntingtin	Negative	PMID:12070670	Adamec E, Mohan P, Vonsattel JP, Nixon RA: Calpain activation in neurodegenerative diseases: confocal immunofluorescence study with antibodies specifically recognizing the active form of calpain 2. Acta Neuropathol. 2002 Jul;104(1):92-104. Epub 2002 Mar 23. The calcium-activated protease calpain cleaves a variety of biologically important proteins and serves, therefore, as a key regulator of many cellular functions. Activation of both main isoforms, calpain 1 and calpain 2, was demonstrated previously in Alzheimer's disease. In this report, antibodies specifically recognizing the active form of calpain 2 were used to investigate calpain 2 activation in a broad range of neurodegenerative diseases, utilizing multiple-label confocal immunofluorescence imaging. With rare exceptions, the active form of calpain 2 was found in colocalization with hyperphosphorylated tau protein. Aggregates of mutated huntingtin, alpha-synuclein, or unidentified protein in motor neuron disease type of frontotemporal dementia were always negative. These findings indicate that calpain 2 activation is not a general response to protein aggregation. In tauopathies, more pathological inclusions were labeled for hyperphosphorylated tau than for activated calpain 2. The extent of colocalization varied in both a disease-specific and cell-type specific manner. The active form of calpain 2 was detected in 50-75% of tau neurofibrillary pathology in Alzheimer's disease, Alzheimer neurofibrillary changes and Down's syndrome, as well as in the accompanying Alzheimer-type tau pathology in diffuse Lewy bodies disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, and corticobasal degeneration. For glial cells, only 10-25% of tuft-shaped astrocytes, glial plaques, or coiled bodies contained activated calpain 2. The majority of Pick bodies were negative. The association of calpain 2 activation with hyperphosphorylated tau might be the result of an attempt by the calpain proteolytic system to degrade the tau protein aggregates. Alternatively, calpain 2 could be directly involved in tau hyperphosphorylation by modulating protein kinase activities. Overall, these results provide evidence of the important role of the calpain proteolytic system in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases with tau neurofibrillary pathology.
motor_neuron_disease	Gemin2	Positive	PMID:15843395	Feng W, Gubitz AK, Wan L, Battle DJ, Dostie J, Golembe TJ, Dreyfuss G: Gemins modulate the expression and activity of the SMN complex. Hum Mol Genet. 2005 Jun 15;14(12):1605-11. Epub 2005 Apr 20. Reduction in the expression of the survival of motor neurons (SMN) protein results in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a common motor neuron degenerative disease. SMN is part of a large macromolecular complex (the SMN complex) that includes at least six additional proteins called Gemins (Gemin2-7). The SMN complex is expressed in all cells and is present throughout the cytoplasm and in the nucleus where it is concentrated in Gems. The SMN complex plays an essential role in the production of spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) and likely other RNPs. To study the roles of the individual proteins, we systematically reduced the expression of SMN and each of the Gemins (2-6) by RNA interference. We show that the reduction of SMN leads to a decrease in snRNP assembly, the disappearance of Gems, and to a drastic reduction in the amounts of several Gemins. Moreover, reduction of Gemin2 or Gemin6 strongly decreases the activity of the SMN complex. These findings demonstrate that other components of the SMN complex, in addition to SMN, are critical for the activity of the complex and suggest that Gemin2 and Gemin6 are potentially important modifiers of SMA as well as potential disease genes for non-SMN motor neuron diseases.

Neurobiol Dis. 2005 Aug;19(3):407-18. A novel peptide with the binding characteristics of tetanus toxin was identified with phage display, for application in therapeutic protein and vector motor and sensory neuron targeting. A 12mer phage library was biopanned on trisialoganglioside (G (T1b)) and eluted with the tetanus toxin C fragment (rTTC). Phage ELISAs revealed increases in G (T1b) binding for the Tet1 and Tet2 phage clones when compared to peptideless phage (PLP). rTTC displaced both Tet1 and Tet2 phage clones from G (T1b), and both clones reduced rTTC-G (T1b) binding. Comparison of Tet1, Tet2, PLP, and the random phage library binding to PC12 and HEK293 cells revealed enhanced cellular binding by Tet1 and Tet2 phage. Tet1 phage binding was selective for neurons. Immunofluorescence also confirmed selective PC12 binding of Tet1 and Tet2 phage. Fluorescein-conjugated synthetic Tet1, but not Tet2, peptide showed strong binding to cultured PC12, primary motor neurons, and dorsal root ganglion (DRG) cells. Synthetic Tet1 bound DRG and motor neurons but not muscle in tissue sections. The enhanced neuronal binding affinity and specificity of Tet1, a novel 12 amino acid peptide, suggests potential utility for targeting neurotherapeutic proteins and viral vectors in the treatment of motor neuron disease, neuropathy, and pain.
motor_neuron_disease	NF-L	Positive	PMID:16236762	Lin H, Zhai J, Schlaepfer WW: RNA-binding protein is involved in aggregation of light neurofilament protein and is implicated in the pathogenesis of motor neuron degeneration. Hum Mol Genet. 2005 Dec 1;14(23):3643-59. Epub 2005 Oct 19. Abnormal protein aggregation is emerging as a common theme in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disease. Our previous studies have shown that overexpression of untranslated light neurofilament (NF-L) RNA causes motor neuron degeneration in transgenic mice, leads to accumulation of ubiquitinated aggregates in degenerating cultured motor neurons and triggers aggregation of NF-L protein and co-aggregation of mutant SOD1 protein in neuronal cells. Here, we report that p190RhoGEF, an RNA-binding protein that binds to a destabilizing element in NF-L mRNA, is involved in aggregation of NF-L protein and is implicated in the pathogenesis of motor neuron degeneration. We show that p190RhoGEF co-aggregates with unassembled NF-L protein and that co-aggregation is associated with down-regulation of parent NF-L mRNA in neuronal cells. Co-expression of NF-M increases NF assembly and reduces RNA-triggered aggregation as well as loss of solubility of NF-L protein. siRNA-induced down-regulation of p190RhoGEF not only reduces aggregation and promotes assembly of NF-L and NF-M, but also causes reversal of aggregation and recovery of NF assembly in transfected cells. Examination of transgenic models of motor neuron disease shows that prominent aggregates of p190RhoGEF and NF-L and down-regulation of NF-L expression occur in degenerating motor neurons of mice expressing untranslated NF-L RNA or a G93A mutant SOD1 transgene. Moreover, aggregates of p190RhoGEF and NF-L appear as early pathological changes in presymptomatic G93A mutant SOD1 transgenic mice. Together, the findings indicate that p190RhoGEF is involved in aggregation of NF-L protein and support a working hypothesis that aggregation of p190RhoGEF and NF-L is an upstream event triggering neurotoxicity in motor neuron disease.
motor_neuron_disease	NF-L	Positive	PMID:15742362	Dubois M, Lalonde R, Julien JP, Strazielle C: Mice with the deleted neurofilament of low-molecular-weight (Nefl) gene: 1. J Neurosci Res. 2005 Jun 15;80(6):741-50. Effects on regional brain metabolism. Neuronal intermediate filaments consist of the NFL subunit linked with NFM and NFH, and their alterations have been proposed as a pathogenesic cause in motor neuron diseases. Depletion of the Nefl gene in mice mimicks the reduced NFL mRNA levels seen in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and causes perikaryal accumulation of neurofilament proteins and axonal hypotrophy in motoneurons. NFL -/- mice were evaluated for regional brain metabolism by means of quantitative histochemical estimation of cytochrome oxidase (COx) activity. The NFL null mice displayed enzymatic activity alterations in numerous hindbrain regions, mainly the cerebellum, connected regions of the brainstem (red nucleus, vestibular nuclei, and reticular formation), and cranial nerve nuclei. All of the affected regions presented elevated COx activity, except for the Purkinje cells of the cerebellum and the magnocellular red nucleus, where enzymatic activity was lower. NFL-disrupted mice displayed functional alterations in brainstem sensorimotor regions affected in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
motor_neuron_disease	NF-L	Positive	PMID:10515233	Meier J, Couillard-Despres S, Jacomy H, Gravel C, Julien JP: Extra neurofilament NF-L subunits rescue motor neuron disease caused by overexpression of the human NF-H gene in mice. J Neuropathol Exp Neurol. 1999 Oct;58(10):1099-110. Previous studies demonstrated that transgenic mice overexpressing human neurofilament heavy (hNF-H) protein develop a progressive motor neuron disease characterized by the perikaryal accumulations of neurofilaments resembling those found in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). To further investigate this neurofilament-induced pathology, we generated transgenic mice expressing, solely or concomitantly, the hNF-H and the human neurofilament light (hNF-L) proteins. We report here that the motor neuron disease caused by excess hNF-H proteins can be rescued by overexpression of hNF-L in a dosage-dependent fashion. In hNF-H transgenic mice, the additional hNF-L led to reduction of perikaryal swellings, relief of axonal transport defect and restoration of axonal radial growth. A gene delivery approach based on recombinant adenoviruses bearing the hNF-L gene also demonstrated the possibility to reduce perikaryal swellings after their formation in adult mice. The finding that extra NF-L can protect against NF-H-mediated pathogenesis is of potential importance for ALS, particularly for cases with NF-H abnormalities.

Neurology. 2006 Dec 26;67(12):2211-6. OBJECTIVE: To search for biologic markers in the Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), we studied CSF samples from patients with GBS and neuropathy of various etiologies for the presence of 14-3-3 protein. METHODS: CSF samples from patients with GBS, chronic neuropathies, motor neuron disease (MND), definite sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD), and normal control subjects were analyzed by standard immunoblot assay, using a polyclonal anti-14-3-3 antibody. CSF samples were also tested with antibodies recognizing specific isoforms of 14-3-3 proteins, either after one-dimensional or two-dimensional electrophoretic separation. RESULTS: A positive 14-3-3 assay was observed in 29 of 38 patients with GBS and in 4 patients with MND and other neuropathies, including 2 subjects with vasculitic neuropathy (VN). In GBS, 14-3-3 protein was detected as early as 12 to 48 hours after disease onset and showed an isoform pattern different from that encountered in patients with noninflammatory neuropathies, VN, MND, and sCJD. Immunohistochemical studies performed in archival fatal GBS cases disclosed marked 14-3-3 expression by mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates and Schwann cells. CONCLUSION: CSF 14-3-3 assay may represent a useful biologic marker in patients with Guillain-Barre syndrome.
motor_neuron_disease	Paraplegin	Negative	PMID:14506940	McDermott CJ, Roberts D, Tomkins J, Bushby KM, Shaw PJ: Spastin and paraplegin gene analysis in selected cases of motor neurone disease (MND). Amyotroph Lateral Scler Other Motor Neuron Disord. 2003 Jun;4(2):96-9. Mutations in both the spastin and paraplegin genes have been associated with upper motor neurone degeneration in hereditary spastic paraparesis. The aim of this study was to investigate if mutation in these genes is associated with upper motor neurone degeneration in primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) or selected motor neurone disease (MND) cases. DNA was extracted from whole blood and screened using single stranded conformation polymorphism and heteroduplex analysis. No mutation in the spastin or paraplegin genes was identified in the PLS or MND cases. Polymorphism was identified in the paraplegin gene but no association was shown with PLS or MND. We therefore conclude that mutation in spastin and paraplegin genes does not appear to cause PLS or MND.
motor_neuron_disease	androgen-receptor	Positive	PMID:17494697	Adachi H, Waza M, Tokui K, Katsuno M, Minamiyama M, Tanaka F, Doyu M, Sobue G: CHIP overexpression reduces mutant androgen receptor protein and ameliorates phenotypes of the spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy transgenic mouse model. J Neurosci. 2007 May 9;27(19):5115-26. Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is an inherited motor neuron disease caused by the expansion of a polyglutamine tract within the androgen receptor (AR). The pathologic features of SBMA are motor neuron loss in the spinal cord and brainstem and diffuse nuclear accumulation and nuclear inclusions of the mutant AR in the residual motor neurons and certain visceral organs. Many components of the ubiquitin-proteasome and molecular chaperones are also sequestered in the inclusions, suggesting that they may be actively engaged in an attempt to degrade or refold the mutant AR. C terminus of Hsc70 (heat shock cognate protein 70)-interacting protein (CHIP), a U-box type E3 ubiquitin ligase, has been shown to interact with heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) or Hsp70 and ubiquitylates unfolded proteins trapped by molecular chaperones and degrades them. Here, we demonstrate that transient overexpression of CHIP in a neuronal cell model reduces the monomeric mutant AR more effectively than it does the wild type, suggesting that the mutant AR is more sensitive to CHIP than is the wild type. High expression of CHIP in an SBMA transgenic mouse model also ameliorated motor symptoms and inhibited neuronal nuclear accumulation of the mutant AR. When CHIP was overexpressed in transgenic SBMA mice, mutant AR was also preferentially degraded over wild-type AR. These findings suggest that CHIP overexpression ameliorates SBMA phenotypes in mice by reducing nuclear-localized mutant AR via enhanced mutant AR degradation. Thus, CHIP overexpression would provide a potential therapeutic avenue for SBMA.
motor_neuron_disease	androgen-receptor	Positive	PMID:16621916	Atsuta N, Watanabe H, Ito M, Banno H, Suzuki K, Katsuno M, Tanaka F, Tamakoshi A, Sobue G: Natural history of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA): a study of 223 Japanese patients. Brain. 2006 Jun;129(Pt 6):1446-55. Epub 2006 Apr 18. Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is an adult-onset motoneuron disease caused by a CAG-repeat expansion in the androgen receptor (AR) gene and for which no curative therapy exists. However, since recent research may provide opportunities for medical treatment, information concerning the natural history of SBMA would be beneficial in planning future clinical trials. We investigated the natural course of SBMA as assessed by nine activities of daily living (ADL) milestones in 223 Japanese SBMA patients (mean age at data collection = 55.2 years; range = 30-87 years) followed from 1 to 20 years. All the patients were diagnosed by genetic analysis. Hand tremor was an early event that was noticed at a median age of 33 years. Muscular weakness occurred predominantly in the lower limbs, and was noticed at a median age of 44 years, followed by the requirement of a handrail to ascend stairs at 49, dysarthria at 50, dysphagia at 54, use of a cane at 59 and a wheelchair at 61 years. Twenty-one of the patients developed pneumonia at a median age of 62 and 15 of them died at a median age of 65 years. The most common cause of death in these cases was pneumonia and respiratory failure. The ages at onset of each ADL milestone were strongly correlated with the length of CAG repeats in the AR gene. However CAG-repeat length did not correlate with the time intervals between each ADL milestone, suggesting that although the onset age of each ADL milestone depends on the CAG-repeat length in the AR gene, the rate of disease progression does not. The levels of serum testosterone, an important triggering factor for polyglutamine-mediated motoneuron degeneration, were maintained at relatively high levels even at advanced ages. These results provide beneficial information for future clinical therapeutic trials, although further detailed prospective studies are also needed.

Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2005 Nov 15;102(46):16801-6. Epub 2005 Oct 31. Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is an adult-onset motor neuron disease caused by the expansion of a trinucleotide CAG repeat encoding the polyglutamine tract in the first exon of the androgen receptor gene (AR). The pathogenic, polyglutamine-expanded AR protein accumulates in the cell nucleus in a ligand-dependent manner and inhibits transcription by interfering with transcriptional factors and coactivators. Heat-shock proteins (HSPs) are stress-induced chaperones that facilitate the refolding and, thus, the degradation of abnormal proteins. Geranylgeranylacetone (GGA), a nontoxic antiulcer drug, has been shown to potently induce HSP expression in various tissues, including the central nervous system. In a cell model of SBMA, GGA increased the levels of Hsp70, Hsp90, and Hsp105 and inhibited cell death and the accumulation of pathogenic AR. Oral administration of GGA also up-regulated the expression of HSPs in the central nervous system of SBMA-transgenic mice and suppressed nuclear accumulation of the pathogenic AR protein, resulting in amelioration of polyglutamine-dependent neuromuscular phenotypes. These observations suggest that, although a high dose appears to be needed for clinical effects, oral GGA administration is a safe and promising therapeutic candidate for polyglutamine-mediated neurodegenerative diseases, including SBMA.

J Appl Genet. 2005;46(2):237-9. Spinobulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is an X-linked form of motor neuron disease characterized by progressive atrophy of the muscles, dysphagia, dysarthria and mild androgen insensitivity. SBMA is caused by CAG repeat expansion in the androgen receptor gene. CAG repeat polymorphism was analysed in a Polish control group (n = 150) and patients suspected of SBMA (n = 60). Normal and abnormal ranges of CAG repeats were established in the control group and in 21 patients whose clinical diagnosis of SBMA was molecularly confirmed. The ranges are similar to those reported for other populations.

Brain. 2005 Mar;128(Pt 3):659-70. Epub 2005 Jan 19. Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is an inherited adult onset motor neuron disease caused by the expansion of a polyglutamine (polyQ) tract within the androgen receptor (AR), affecting only males. The characteristic pathological finding is nuclear inclusions (NIs) consisting of mutant AR with an expanded polyQ in residual motor neurons, and in certain visceral organs. We immunohistochemically examined 11 SBMA patients at autopsy with 1C2, an antibody that specifically recognizes expanded polyQ. Our study demonstrated that diffuse nuclear accumulation of mutant AR was far more frequent and extensive than NIs being distributed in a wide array of CNS nuclei, and in more visceral organs than thus far believed. Mutant AR accumulation was also present in the cytoplasm, particularly in the Golgi apparatus; nuclear or cytoplasmic predominance of accumulation was tissue specific. Furthermore, the extent of diffuse nuclear accumulation of mutant AR in motor and sensory neurons of the spinal cord was closely related to CAG repeat length. Thus, diffuse nuclear accumulation of mutant AR apparently is a cardinal pathogenetic process underlying neurological manifestations, as in SBMA transgenic mice, while cytoplasmic accumulation may also contribute to SBMA pathophysiology.
motor_neuron_disease	androgen-receptor	Positive	PMID:15152038	Chevalier-Larsen ES, O'Brien CJ, Wang H, Jenkins SC, Holder L, Lieberman AP, Merry DE: Castration restores function and neurofilament alterations of aged symptomatic males in a transgenic mouse model of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy. J Neurosci. 2004 May 19;24(20):4778-86. Transgenic models of neurodegenerative disease have proved uniquely powerful for delineating pathways of neuronal dysfunction and cell death. We have developed a transgenic model of the polyglutamine disease spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), an adult-onset, slowly progressive motor neuron disease caused by polyglutamine expansion in the androgen receptor (AR). Mice bearing a human AR with 112 glutamines reproduce many aspects of SBMA, including slowly progressive, gender-specific motor deficits, and neuronal intranuclear inclusions. Despite substantial motor deficits in male AR112Q mice, no motor neuron loss was observed, indicating that neuronal dysfunction, rather than neuronal death, is central to disease. Moreover, reduced levels of unphosphorylated neurofilament heavy chain (NF-H) were observed in motor neurons, suggesting a role for NF-H in SBMA neuronal dysfunction. The elimination of androgens by surgical castration of severely affected, aged 112Q male mice partially restored motor function as well as NF-H levels. These data suggest that hormone-based therapies designed to treat SBMA patients, even with advanced disease, are likely to be effective.

Hum Mol Genet. 2004 Jun 1;13(11):1183-92. Epub 2004 Apr 21. Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is an inherited motor neuron disease caused by the expansion of a polyglutamine (polyQ) tract within the androgen receptor. Unifying mechanisms have been implicated in the pathogenesis of polyQ-dependent neurodegenerative diseases including SBMA, Huntington disease and spinocerebellar ataxias. It has been suggested that mutant protein containing polyQ inhibits histone acetyltransferase activity, resulting in transcriptional dysfunction and subsequent neuronal dysfunction. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors alleviate neurological phenotypes in fly and mouse models of polyQ disease, although the therapeutic effect is limited by the toxicity of these compounds. We studied the therapeutic effects of sodium butyrate (SB), an HDAC inhibitor, in a transgenic mouse model of SBMA. Oral administration of SB ameliorated neurological phenotypes as well as increased acetylation of nuclear histone in neural tissues. These therapeutic effects, however, were seen only within a narrow range of SB dosage. Our results indicate that SB is a possible therapeutic agent for SBMA and other polyQ diseases, although an appropriate dose should be determined for clinical application.

J Neurosci. 2003 Mar 15;23(6):2203-11. Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is an inherited motor neuron disease caused by the expansion of the polyglutamine (polyQ) tract within the androgen receptor (AR). The nuclear inclusions consisting of the mutant AR protein are characteristic and combine with many components of ubiquitin-proteasome and molecular chaperone pathways, raising the possibility that misfolding and altered degradation of mutant AR may be involved in the pathogenesis. We have reported that the overexpression of heat shock protein (HSP) chaperones reduces mutant AR aggregation and cell death in a neuronal cell model (Kobayashi et al., 2000). To determine whether increasing the expression level of chaperone improves the phenotype in a mouse model, we cross-bred SBMA transgenic mice with mice overexpressing the inducible form of human HSP70. We demonstrated that high expression of HSP70 markedly ameliorated the motor function of the SBMA model mice. In double-transgenic mice, the nuclear-localized mutant AR protein, particularly that of the large complex form, was significantly reduced. Monomeric mutant AR was also reduced in amount by HSP70 overexpression, suggesting the enhanced degradation of mutant AR. These findings suggest that HSP70 overexpression ameliorates SBMA phenotypes in mice by reducing nuclear-localized mutant AR, probably caused by enhanced mutant AR degradation. Our study may provide the basis for the development of an HSP70-related therapy for SBMA and other polyQ diseases.

Hum Mol Genet. 2002 Sep 1;11(18):2103-11. Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is an adult-onset motor neuron disease, caused by the expansion of a trinucleotide repeat (TNR) in exon 1 of the androgen receptor (AR) gene. This disorder is characterized by degeneration of motor and sensory neurons, proximal muscular atrophy, and endocrine abnormalities, such as gynecomastia and reduced fertility. We describe the development of a transgenic model of SBMA expressing a full-length human AR (hAR) cDNA carrying 65 (AR (65)) or 120 CAG repeats (AR (120)), with widespread expression driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter. Mice carrying the AR (120) transgene displayed behavioral and motor dysfunction, while mice carrying 65 CAG repeats showed a mild phenotype. Progressive muscle weakness and atrophy was observed in AR (120) mice and was associated with the loss of alpha-motor neurons in the spinal cord. There was no evidence of neurodegeneration in other brain structures. Motor dysfunction was observed in both male and female animals, showing that in SBMA the polyglutamine repeat expansion causes a dominant gain-of-function mutation in the AR. The male mice displayed a progressive reduction in sperm production consistent with testis defects reported in human patients. These mice represent the first model to reproduce the key features of SBMA, making them a useful resource for characterizing disease progression, and for testing therapeutic strategies for both polyglutamine and motor neuron diseases.
motor_neuron_disease	androgen-receptor	Positive	PMID:11751688	Welch WJ, Diamond MI: Glucocorticoid modulation of androgen receptor nuclear aggregation and cellular toxicity is associated with distinct forms of soluble expanded polyglutamine protein. Hum Mol Genet. 2001 Dec 15;10(26):3063-74. Spinobulbar muscular atrophy is a progressive motor neuron disease caused by abnormal polyglutamine tract expansion in the androgen receptor (AR) gene, and is part of a family of central nervous system (CNS) neurodegenerative diseases, including Huntington's disease (HD). Each pathologic protein is widely expressed, but the cause of neuronal degeneration within the CNS remains unknown. Many reports now link abnormal polyglutamine protein aggregation to pathogenesis. A previous study reported that activation of the wild-type glucocorticoid receptor (wtGR) suppressed the aggregation of expanded polyglutamine proteins derived from AR and huntingtin, whereas a mutant receptor containing an internal deletion, GRDelta108-317, increased polyglutamine protein aggregation, in this case primarily within the nucleus. In this study, we use these two forms of GR to study expanded polyglutamine AR protein in different cell contexts. Using cell biology and biochemical approaches, we find that wtGR promotes soluble forms of the protein and prevents nuclear aggregation in NIH3T3 cells and cultured neurons. In contrast, GRDelta108-317 decreases polyglutamine protein solubility, and causes formation of nuclear aggregates in non-neuronal cells. Nuclear aggregates recruit hsp72 more rapidly than cytoplasmic aggregates, and are associated with decreased cell viability. Limited proteolysis and chemical cross-linking suggest unique soluble forms of the expanded AR protein underlie these distinct biological activities. These observations provide an experimental framework to understand why expanded polyglutamine proteins may be toxic only to certain populations of cells, and suggest that unique protein associations or conformations of expanded polyglutamine proteins may determine subsequent cellular effects such as nuclear localization and cellular toxicity.
motor_neuron_disease	complex-I	Negative	PMID:17512091	Diwakar L, Kenchappa RS, Annepu J, Ravindranath V: Downregulation of glutaredoxin but not glutathione loss leads to mitochondrial dysfunction in female mice CNS: Implications in excitotoxicity. Neurochem Int. 2007 Jul;51(1):37-46. Epub 2007 Apr 5. Oxidative stress, excitotoxicity and mitochondrial dysfunction play synergistic roles in neurodegeneration. Maintenance of thiol homeostasis is important for normal mitochondrial function and dysregulation of protein thiol homeostasis by oxidative stress leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and neurodegeneration. We examined the critical roles played by the antioxidant, non-protein thiol, glutathione and related enzyme, glutaredoxin in maintaining mitochondrial function during excitotoxicity caused by beta-N-oxalyl amino-l-alanine (l-BOAA), the causative factor of neurolathyrism, a motor neuron disease involving the pyramidal system. l-BOAA causes loss of GSH and inhibition of mitochondrial complex I in lumbosacral cord of male mice through oxidation of thiol groups, while female mice are resistant. Reducing GSH levels in female mice CNS by pretreatment with diethyl maleate or l-propargyl glycine did not result in inhibition of complex I activity, unlike male mice. Further, treatment of female mice depleted of GSH with l-BOAA did not induce inhibition of complex I indicating that GSH levels were not critical for maintaining complex I activity in female mice unlike their male counterpart. Glutaredoxin, a thiol disulfide oxidoreductase helps maintain redox status of proteins and downregulation of glutaredoxin results in loss of mitochondrial complex I activity. Female mice express higher levels of glutaredoxin in certain CNS regions and downregulation of glutaredoxin using antisense oligonucleotides sensitizes them to l-BOAA toxicity seen as mitochondrial complex I loss. Ovariectomy downregulates glutaredoxin and renders female mice vulnerable to l-BOAA toxicity as evidenced by activation of AP1, loss of GSH and complex I activity indicating the important role of glutaredoxin in neuroprotection. Estrogen protects against mitochondrial dysfunction caused by excitotoxicity by maintaining cellular redox status through higher constitutive expression of glutaredoxin in the CNS. Therapeutic interventions designed to upregulate glutaredoxin may offer neuroprotection against excitotoxicity in motor neurons.
motor_neuron_disease	complex-I	Negative	PMID:17095121	Diwakar L, Ravindranath V: Inhibition of cystathionine-gamma-lyase leads to loss of glutathione and aggravation of mitochondrial dysfunction mediated by excitatory amino acid in the CNS. Neurochem Int. 2007 Jan;50(2):418-26. Epub 2006 Nov 13. Oxidative stress has been implicated in the pathogenesis and progression of neurodegenerative disorders and antioxidants potentially have a major role in neuroprotection. Optimum levels of glutathione (gamma-glutamylcysteinyl glycine), an endogenous thiol antioxidant are required for the maintenance of the redox status of cells. Cystathionine gamma-lyase is the rate-limiting enzyme for the synthesis of cysteine from methionine and availability of cysteine is a critical factor in glutathione synthesis. In the present study, we have examined the role of cystathionine gamma-lyase in maintaining the redox homeostasis in brain, particularly with reference to mitochondrial function since the complex I of the electron transport chain is sensitive to redox perturbation. Inhibition of cystathionine gamma-lyase by l-propargylglycine caused loss of glutathione and decrease in complex I activity in the brain although the enzyme activity in mouse brain was 1% of the corresponding hepatic activity. We then examined the effect of this inhibition on the neurotoxicity mediated by the excitatory amino acid, l-beta-oxalyl amino-l-alanine, which is the causative factor of a type of motor neuron disease, neurolathyrism. l-beta-Oxalyl amino-l-alanine toxicity was exacerbated by l-propargylglycine measured as loss of complex I activity indicating the importance of cystathionine gamma-lyase in maintaining glutathione levels and in turn the mitochondrial function during excitotoxicity. Oxidative stress generated by l-beta-oxalyl amino-l-alanine itself inhibited cystathionine gamma-lyase, which could be prevented by prior treatment with thiol antioxidant. Thus, cystathionine gamma-lyase itself is susceptible to inactivation by oxidative stress and this can potentially exacerbate oxidant-induced damage. Cystathionine gamma-lyase is present in neuronal cells in human brain and its activity is several-fold higher compared to mouse brain. It could potentially play an important role in maintaining glutathione and protein thiol homeostasis in brain and hence afford neuroprotection.
motor_neuron_disease	ALS2	Positive	PMID:17566607	Hadano S, Kunita R, Otomo A, Suzuki-Utsunomiya K, Ikeda JE: Molecular and cellular function of ALS2/alsin: Implication of membrane dynamics in neuronal development and degeneration. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2006 Jun 20;103(25):9595-600. Epub 2006 Jun 12. ALS2 is a causative gene for a juvenile autosomal recessive form of motor neuron diseases (MNDs), including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 2 (ALS2), juvenile primary lateral sclerosis, and infantile-onset ascending hereditary spastic paralysis. These disorders are characterized by ascending degeneration of the upper motor neurons with or without lower motor neuron involvement. Thus far, a total of 12 independent ALS2 mutations, which include a small deletion, non-sense mutation, or missense mutation spreading widely across the entire coding sequence, are reported. They are predicted to result in either premature termination of translation or substitution of an evolutionarily conserved amino acid. Thus, a loss of functions in the ALS2-coded protein accounts for motor dysfunction and/or degeneration in the ALS2-linked MNDs. The ALS2 gene encodes a novel 184kDa protein of 1657 amino acids, ALS2 or alsin, comprising three predicted guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) domains: the N-terminal RCC1-like domain, the central Dbl homology and pleckstrin homology (DH/PH) domains, and the C-terminal vacuolar protein sorting 9 (VPS9) domain. In addition, eight consecutive membrane occupation and recognition nexus (MORN) motifs are noted in the region between DH/PH and VPS9 domains. ALS2 activates Rab5 small GTPase and involves in endosome/membrane trafficking and fusions in the cells, and also promotes neurite outgrowth in neuronal cultures. Further, a neuroprotective role for ALS2 against cytotoxicity; i.e., the mutant Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1)-mediated toxicity, oxidative stress, and excitotoxicity, has recently been implied. This review outlines current understandings of the molecular and cellular functions of ALS2 and its related proteins on safeguarding the integrity of motor neurons, and sheds light on the molecular pathogenesis of MNDs as well as other conditions of neurodegenerative diseases.
motor_neuron_disease	ALS2	Positive	PMID:17409386	Kunita R, Otomo A, Mizumura H, Suzuki-Utsunomiya K, Hadano S, Ikeda JE: The Rab5 activator ALS2/alsin acts as a novel Rac1 effector through Rac1-activated endocytosis. J Neurosci. 2005 Aug 17;25(33):7567-74. Mutations in the ALS2 gene cause a number of recessive motor neuron diseases, indicating that the ALS2 protein (ALS2/alsin) is vital for motor neurons. ALS2 acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rab5 (Rab5GEF) and is involved in endosome dynamics. However, the spatiotemporal regulation of the ALS2-mediated Rab5 activation is unclear. Here we identified an upstream activator for ALS2 and showed a functional significance of the ALS2 activation in endosome dynamics. ALS2 preferentially interacts with activated Rac1. In the cells activated Rac1 recruits cytoplasmic ALS2 to membrane ruffles and subsequently to nascent macropinosomes via Rac1-activated macropinocytosis. At later endocytic stages macropinosomal ALS2 augments fusion of the ALS2-localized macropinosomes with the transferrin-positive endosomes, depending on the ALS2-associated Rab5GEF activity. These results indicate that Rac1 promotes the ALS2 membranous localization, thereby rendering ALS2 active via Rac1-activated endocytosis. Thus, ALS2 is a novel Rac1 effector and is involved in Rac1-activated macropinocytosis. All together, loss of ALS2 may perturb macropinocytosis and/or the following membrane trafficking, which gives rise to neuronal dysfunction in the ALS2-linked motor neuron diseases.
motor_neuron_disease	ALS2	Positive	PMID:17239822	Suzuki-Utsunomiya K, Hadano S, Otomo A, Kunita R, Mizumura H, Osuga H, Ikeda JE: ALS2CL, a novel ALS2-interactor, modulates ALS2-mediated endosome dynamics. Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2007 Mar 9;354(2):491-7. Epub 2007 Jan 11. ALS2, the causative gene product for a number of recessive motor neuron diseases, is a guanine-nucleotide exchange factor for Rab5, and acts as a modulator for endosome dynamics. Recently, we have identified a novel ALS2 homolog, ALS2CL, which is highly homologous to the C-terminal half of ALS2. In this study, we investigate the molecular features of ALS2CL and its functional relationship with ALS2. A majority of ALS2CL is present as a homo-dimeric form, which can interact with the ALS2-oligomer, resulting in the formation of the large ALS2/ALS2CL heteromeric complex. In cultured cells, overexpressed ALS2CL is colocalized with ALS2 onto membranous compartments. Further, ALS2CL dominantly suppresses the endosome enlargement induced by a constitutively active form of ALS2, and results in an extensive perinuclear tubulo-membranous phenotype, which are dependent upon the ALS2CL-ALS2 interaction. Collectively, ALS2CL is a novel ALS2-interacting protein and is implicated in ALS2-mediated endosome dynamics.

J Neurosci. 2006 Nov 8;26(45):11798-806. Dysfunction of the ALS2 gene has been linked to one form of juvenile onset autosomal recessive amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Previous in vitro studies suggest that over-expression of ALS2 protects cells from mutant Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1)-induced cytotoxicity. To test whether ALS2 plays a protective role against mutant SOD1-mediated motor neuron degeneration in vivo, we examined the progression of motor neuron disease in SOD1 (G93A) mice on an ALS2 null background. Our data suggest that deficiency in the ALS2 gene does not affect the pathogenesis of SOD1 (G93A) mice.

Neurobiol Aging. 2006 Sep 11;. OBJECTIVE: Homozygous mutation in the ALS2 gene and the resulting loss of the guanine exchange factor activity of the ALS2 protein is causative for autosomal recessive early-onset motor neuron disease that is thought to predominantly affect upper motor neurons. The goal of this study was to elucidate how the motor system is affected by the deletion of ALS2. METHODS: ALS2-deficient mice were generated by gene targeting. Motor function and upper and lower motor neuron pathology were examined in ALS2-deficient mice and in mutant superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) mice that develop ALS-like disease from expression of an ALS-linked mutation in SOD1. RESULTS: ALS2-deficient mice demonstrated progressive axonal degeneration in the lateral spinal cord that is also prominent in mutant SOD1 mice. Despite the vulnerability of these spinal axons, lower motor neurons in ALS2-deficient mice were preserved. Behavioral studies demonstrated slowed movement without muscle weakness in ALS2 (-/-) mice, consistent with upper motor neuron defects that lead to spasticity in humans. INTERPRETATION: The combined evidence from mice and humans shows that deficiency in ALS2 causes an upper motor neuron disease that in humans closely resembles a severe form of hereditary spastic paralysis, and that is quite distinct from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

Biochim Biophys Acta. 2005 Aug 15;1745(1):84-100. Epub 2005 Jan 19. ALS2 is an autosomal recessive form of spastic paraparesis (motor neuron disease) with juvenile onset and slow progression caused by loss of function of alsin, an activator of Rac1 and Rab5 small GTPases. To establish an animal model of ALS2 and derive insights into the pathogenesis of this illness, we have generated alsin-null mice. Cytosol from brains of Als2 (-/-) mice shows marked diminution of Rab5-dependent endosome fusion activity. Furthermore, primary neurons from Als2 (-/-) mice show a disturbance in endosomal transport of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) and BDNF receptors, whereas neuronal viability and endocytosis of transferrin and dextran seem unaltered. There is a significant decrease in the size of cortical motor neurons, and Als2 (-/-) mice are mildly hypoactive. Altered trophic receptor trafficking in neurons of Als2 (-/-) mice may underlie the histopathological and behavioral changes observed and the pathogenesis of ALS2.
motor_neuron_disease	ALS2	Positive	PMID:16473597	Hadano S, Ikeda JE: Purification and functional analyses of ALS2 and its homologue.  227-30. ALS2 is a causative gene product for a form of the familial motor neuron diseases. Computational genomic analysis identified ALS2CL, which is a novel protein highly homologous to the C-terminal region of ALS2. Both proteins contain the VPS9 domain, which is a hallmark for all known members of the guanine nucleotide exchange factors for Rab5 (Rab5GEF), and are known to act as novel factors modulating the Rab5-mediated endosome dynamics in the cells. It has also been reported that oligomerization of ALS2 is one of the fundamental features of its biochemical and physiological function involving endosome dynamics. This chapter describes methods, including purification of the recombinant ALS2 and ALS2CL, and Rab5GEF assay, which have been utilized to clarify the molecular function for ALS2 and ALS2CL.

J Biol Chem. 2007 Jun 1;282(22):16599-611. Epub 2007 Apr 4. ALS2/alsin is a member of guanine nucleotide exchange factors for the small GTPase Rab5 (Rab5GEFs), which act as modulators in endocytic pathway. Loss-of-function mutations in human ALS2 account for a number of juvenile recessive motor neuron diseases (MNDs). However, the normal physiological role of ALS2 in vivo and the molecular mechanisms underlying motor dysfunction are still unknown. To address these issues, we have generated mice homozygous for disruption of the Als2 gene. The Als2-null mice observed through 21 months of age demonstrated no obvious developmental, reproductive or motor abnormalities. However, immunohistochemical and electrophysiological analyses identified an age-dependent, slowly progressive loss of cerebellar Purkinje cells and disturbance of spinal motor neurons associated with astrocytosis and microglial cell activation, indicating a subclinical dysfunction of motor system in Als2-null mice. Further, quantitative epidermal growth factor (EGF)-uptake analysis identified significantly smaller-sized EGF-positive endosomes in Als2-null fibroblasts, suggesting an alteration of endosome/vesicle trafficking in the cells. Collectively, while loss of ALS2 does not produce a severe disease phenotype in mice, these Als2-null animals should provide a useful model with which to understand the interplay between endosomal dynamics and the long-term viability of large neurons such as Purkinje cells and spinal motor neurons.
motor_neuron_disease	ALS2	Positive	PMID:15651293	Ikeda JE: [Recessive motor neuron diseases: mutations in the ALS2 gene and molecular pathogenesis for the upper motor neurodegeneration]. Ann Neurol. 2006 Jul;60(1):95-104. We have initially identified a mutation in ALS2 as a causative for a juvenile autosomal recessive form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), termed ALS2 (OMIM 205100). ALS2 mutations also are causative for an autosomal recessive juvenile primary lateral sclerosis, and infantile-ascending hereditary spastic paralysis. To date, nine homozygous ALS2 mutaions from nine independent families have been identified. All of these mutations result in predicted premature translation termination caused by the recessive frameshift or nonsense mutation. ALS2 is a 184-kD protein comprising several putative guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) domains [RLD; RCC1 like domain, DH. PH domain, VPS9; Vacuolar protein sorting 9 domain]. In vitro, ALS2 specifically binds to the small GTPase Rab5 and functions as a GEF for Rab5. Ectopic expression of full-length ALS2 has further implied an association with endosomal membranes mediated by the VPS9 domain, consistent with ALS2 involvement in endosomal trafficking and fusion in conjunction with the activation of Rab5. These results combined with our findings suggest that an obstruction of endosomal dynamics might underlie neuronal dysfunction and degeneration in ALS2, PLSJ, and HSP, as well as in a number of other motor neuron diseases.
motor_neuron_disease	ALS2	Positive	PMID:14970233	Kanekura K, Hashimoto Y, Niikura T, Aiso S, Matsuoka M, Nishimoto I: Alsin, the product of ALS2 gene, suppresses SOD1 mutant neurotoxicity through RhoGEF domain by interacting with SOD1 mutants. J Biol Chem. 2004 Apr 30;279(18):19247-56. Epub 2004 Feb 16. Mutation of the ALS2 gene encoding alsin is linked to the onset of autosomal recessive motor neuron diseases, including juvenile-onset amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Alsin long form (LF) belongs to the family of the guanine nucleotide exchanging factor (GEF) for small GTPases. Expression of alsin LF, but not alsin short form, protected motor neuronal cells from toxicity induced by mutants of the Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1) gene, which cause autosomal dominant ALS. In contrast, expression of alsin did not suppress neurotoxicity by other neurodegenerative insults such as Alzheimer's disease-related genes. Deletion analysis of alsin LF demonstrated that the RhoGEF domain is essential for alsin-mediated neuroprotection. Furthermore, we found that alsin LF bound to SOD1 mutants, but not to wtSOD1, via the RhoGEF domain. Such functional and physical interaction between two ALS-related genes will become a promising clue to clarify the pathogenesis of ALS and other motor neuron diseases.

Muscle Nerve. 2005 Dec;32(6):734-44. Recent work implicates excitotoxicity-induced apoptosis as the mechanism triggering motor neuron death in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Our laboratory has previously utilized glutamate excitotoxicity in vitro to study this process. The present experiment tests whether overexpression of the gene for Bcl-xL can inhibit excitotoxicity in this model system. To track Bcl-xL expression, the gene for green fluorescent protein (GFP) was inserted in-frame, upstream of the Bcl-xL gene. The GFP-Bcl-xL gene was then cloned into an adeno-associated viral (AAV2) vector. GFP expression in both SH-SY5Y and embryonic day 15 (E15) motor neurons (MNs) peaked 48 hours after infection. Bcl-xL expression in SH-SY5Y cells significantly reduced terminal deoxy-UTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells and maintained cell density after glutamate exposure. Similarly, Bcl-xL expression inhibited the development of TUNEL staining in E15 MNs and supported cell density after glutamate exposure. These findings suggest that AAV-mediated expression of genes for antiapoptotic proteins may provide a means for ALS gene therapy.
motor_neuron_disease	PU.1	Negative	PMID:17043238	Beers DR, Henkel JS, Xiao Q, Zhao W, Wang J, Yen AA, Siklos L, McKercher SR, Appel SH: Wild-type microglia extend survival in PU.1 knockout mice with familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2006 Oct 24;103(43):16021-6. Epub 2006 Oct 16. The most common inherited form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a neurodegenerative disease affecting adult motoneurons, is caused by dominant mutations in the ubiquitously expressed Cu (2+)/Zn (2+) superoxide dismutase (SOD1). Recent studies suggest that glia may contribute to motoneuron injury in animal models of familial ALS. To determine whether the expression of mutant SOD1 (mSOD1 (G93A)) in CNS microglia contributes to motoneuron injury, PU.1 (-/-) mice that are unable to develop myeloid and lymphoid cells received bone marrow transplants resulting in donor-derived microglia. Donor-derived microglia from mice overexpressing mSOD1 (G93A), an animal model of familial ALS, transplanted into PU.1 (-/-) mice could not induce weakness, motoneuron injury, or an ALS-like disease. To determine whether expression of mSOD1 (G93A) in motoneurons and astroglia, as well as microglia, was required to produce motoneuron disease, PU.1 (-/-) mice were bred with mSOD1 (G93A) mice. In mSOD1 (G93A)/PU.1 (-/-) mice, wild-type donor-derived microglia slowed motoneuron loss and prolonged disease duration and survival when compared with mice receiving mSOD1 (G93A) expressing cells or mSOD1 (G93A) mice. In vitro studies confirmed that wild-type microglia were less neurotoxic than similarly cultured mSOD1 (G93A) microglia. Compared with wild-type microglia, mSOD1 (G93A) microglia produced and released more superoxide and nitrite+nitrate, and induced more neuronal death. These data demonstrate that the expression of mSOD1 (G93A) results in activated and neurotoxic microglia, and suggests that the lack of mSOD1 (G93A) expression in microglia may contribute to motoneuron protection. This study confirms the importance of microglia as a double-edged sword, and focuses on the importance of targeting microglia to minimize cytotoxicity and maximize neuroprotection in neurodegenerative diseases.
motor_neuron_disease	insulin-like-growth-factor-I	Positive	PMID:12645079	Sakamoto T, Kawazoe Y, Shen JS, Takeda Y, Arakawa Y, Ogawa J, Oyanagi K, Ohashi T, Watanabe K, Inoue K, Eto Y, Watabe K: Adenoviral gene transfer of GDNF, BDNF and TGF beta 2, but not CNTF, cardiotrophin-1 or IGF1, protects injured adult motoneurons after facial nerve avulsion. Neurol Res. 2005 Oct;27(7):768-72. We examined neuroprotective effects of recombinant adenoviral vectors encoding glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), cardiotrophin-1 (CT1), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1), and transforming growth factor-beta2 (TGFbeta2) on lesioned adult rat facial motoneurons. The right facial nerves of adult Fischer 344 male rats were avulsed and removed from the stylomastoid foramen, and adenoviral vectors were injected into the facial canal. Animals avulsed and treated with adenovirus encoding GDNF, BDNF, CNTF, CT1, IGF1 and TGFbeta2 showed intense immunolabeling for these factors in lesioned facial motoneurons, respectively, indicating adenoviral induction of the neurotrophic factors in these neurons. The treatment with adenovirus encoding GDNF, BDNF, or TGFbeta2 after avulsion significantly prevented the loss of lesioned facial motoneurons, improved choline acetyltransferase immunoreactivity and prevented the induction of nitric oxide synthase activity in these neurons. The treatment with adenovirus encoding CNTF, CT1 or IGF1, however, failed to protect these neurons after avulsion. These results indicate that the gene transfer of GDNF and BDNF and TGFbeta2 but not CNTF, CT1 or IGF1 may prevent the degeneration of motoneurons in adult humans with motoneuron injury and motor neuron diseases.
motor_neuron_disease	insulin-like-growth-factor-I	Positive	PMID:10817918	Di Giulio AM, Germani E, Lesma E, Muller E, Gorio A: Glycosaminoglycans co-administration enhance insulin-like growth factor-I neuroprotective and neuroregenerative activity in traumatic and genetic models of motor neuron disease: a review. Int J Dev Neurosci. 2000 Jul-Aug;18(4-5):339-46. In this report it is shown how glycosaminoglycans and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) promote muscle reinnervation and prevent motor neuron death in experimental models of motor neuron disease. Such effect appears to be mediated by insulin-like growth factor-1. The glycosaminoglycan moiety of proteoglycans is a constituent of the basal lamina active on nerve regeneration by means of the interaction with laminin and with several growth factors. We have previously shown that supplementation by means of subcutaneous injections of glycosaminoglycans affects neuronal degeneration and regeneration. In this study we report that following neonatal lesion of the rat sciatic nerve, glycosaminoglycan treatment promoted extensor digitorum longus muscle reinnervation with consequent improvement of muscle morphology. In saline-treated rats, reinnervation was only partial and there was a marked muscle fibre atrophy, whereas, glycosaminoglycan treatment of lesioned rats increased IGF-I mRNA and protein in the reinnervated muscle, and IGF-I and insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 plasma levels. Similarly, treatment of lesioned rats with IGF-I promoted muscle reinnervation, and prevented muscle fibre atrophy, higher levels of IGF-I in the reinnervated muscle, of IGF-I, and insulin-like growth factor binding proteins in plasma. In the wobbler mouse IGF-I and glycosaminoglycans alone promote only a partial motor neuron survival and the preservation of forelimb function decays after 3 weeks of treatment. However when glycosaminoglycans and insulin-like growth factor are administered together the motor neuron disease in the wobbler mouse is halted and there is no more loss of motor neurons.
motor_neuron_disease	VPS9-domain	Positive	PMID:12837691	Otomo A, Hadano S, Okada T, Mizumura H, Kunita R, Nishijima H, Showguchi-Miyata J, Yanagisawa Y, Kohiki E, Suga E, Yasuda M, Osuga H, Nishimoto T, Narumiya S, Ikeda JE: ALS2, a novel guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the small GTPase Rab5, is implicated in endosomal dynamics. Hum Mol Genet. 2003 Jul 15;12(14):1671-87. ALS2 mutations account for a number of recessive motor neuron diseases including forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, primary lateral sclerosis and hereditary spastic paraplegia. Although computational predictions suggest that ALS2 encodes a protein containing multiple guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) domains [RCC1-like domain (RLD), the Dbl homology and pleckstrin homology (DH/PH), and the vacuolar protein sorting 9 (VPS9)], the functions of the ALS2 protein have not been revealed as yet. Here we show that the ALS2 protein specifically binds to small GTPase Rab5 and functions as a GEF for Rab5. Ectopically expressed ALS2 protein localizes with Rab5 and early endosome antigen-1 (EEA1) onto early endosomal compartments and stimulates the enlargement of endosomes in cultured cortical neurons. The carboxy-terminus of ALS2 protein carrying a VPS9 domain mediates not only the activation of Rab5 via a guanine-nucleotide exchanging reaction but also the endosomal localization of the ALS2 protein, while the amino-terminal half containing RLD acts suppressive in its membranous localization. Further, the DH/PH domain in the middle portion of ALS2 protein enhances the VPS9 domain-mediated endosome fusions. Taken together, the ALS2 protein as a novel Rab5-GEF, ALS2rab5GEF seems to be implicated in the endosomal dynamics in vivo. Notably, a feature common to eight reported ALS2 mutations among motor neuron diseases is the loss of VPS9 domain, resulting in the failure of Rab5 activation. Thus, a perturbation of endosomal dynamics caused by loss of ALS2 rab5GEF activity might underlie neuronal dysfunction and degeneration in a number of motor neuron diseases.
motor_neuron_disease	alpha-synuclein	Negative	PMID:16406315	Sasaki S, Komori T, Iwata M: Neuronal inclusions in sporadic motor neuron disease are negative for alpha-synuclein. Neurosci Lett. 2006 Apr 10-17;397(1-2):15-9. Epub 2006 Jan 6. Alpha-synuclein has been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases characterized by Lewy bodies. However, we have only scanty information on the immunoreactivity of alpha-synuclein in other inclusion bodies such as the Lewy body-like inclusions and the skein-like inclusions observed in motor neuron disease (MND). In this report, we immunocytochemically investigated inclusion bodies observed in the anterior horn neurons of the spinal cord in 29 patients with sporadic MND. Sixteen age-matched patients without any neurological disease served as controls. In MND patients, we recognized Lewy body-like hyaline inclusions, skein-like inclusions, Bunina bodies, basophilic inclusions, and intracytoplasmic hyaline (colloid) inclusions, but none of them were immunostained for alpha-synuclein. Our findings in this study do not support the hypothesis that MND could be classified as one of the diseases grouped as alpha-synucleinopathies.
motor_neuron_disease	alpha-synuclein	Negative	PMID:14991384	Yokota O, Terada S, Ishizu H, Ishihara T, Nakashima H, Kugo A, Tsuchiya K, Ikeda K, Hayabara T, Saito Y, Murayama S, Ueda K, Checler F, Kuroda S: Increased expression of neuronal cyclooxygenase-2 in the hippocampus in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis both with and without dementia. Acta Neuropathol. 2004 May;107(5):399-405. Epub 2004 Feb 25. The pathophysiological basis of cognitive dysfunction, including frontotemporal dementia (FTD), in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and ALS with dementia (ALSD) remains unclear. On the other hand, increased expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in the spinal cord is thought to play a pivotal role in motor neuron degeneration in ALS. In this study, to assess the relationship between the neuronal COX-2 expression in the cerebrum, the formation of tau- and alpha-synuclein-negative but ubiquitin-positive neuronal inclusions (UPIs), and dementia in motor neuron disease (MND), we examined neuronal COX-2 immunoreactivity in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of patients with non-demented ALS without UPIs ( n=11), ALSD with UPIs ( n=6), and normal controls ( n=24) using a quantitative immunohistochemical technique. Neuronal COX-2 expression in all CA1-4 in the hippocampus was significantly up-regulated in the ALSD group, and, to lesser degree but significantly, in the ALS group. Neuronal COX-2 expression in the frontal cortex was also significantly up-regulated in the ALSD group but not in the ALS group. These findings suggest that (1) the frontal cortex and hippocampus of MND are involved in the same pathogenic process associated with COX-2 induction that has been observed in spinal anterior horn cells, (2) COX-2 induction in the cerebrum is a pathogenic process that can occur even in the absence of UPI formation in MND, and (3) COX-2 expression in the cerebrum may be associated with cognitive dysfunction in MND.
motor_neuron_disease	alpha-synuclein	Negative	PMID:12070670	Adamec E, Mohan P, Vonsattel JP, Nixon RA: Calpain activation in neurodegenerative diseases: confocal immunofluorescence study with antibodies specifically recognizing the active form of calpain 2. Acta Neuropathol. 2002 Jul;104(1):92-104. Epub 2002 Mar 23. The calcium-activated protease calpain cleaves a variety of biologically important proteins and serves, therefore, as a key regulator of many cellular functions. Activation of both main isoforms, calpain 1 and calpain 2, was demonstrated previously in Alzheimer's disease. In this report, antibodies specifically recognizing the active form of calpain 2 were used to investigate calpain 2 activation in a broad range of neurodegenerative diseases, utilizing multiple-label confocal immunofluorescence imaging. With rare exceptions, the active form of calpain 2 was found in colocalization with hyperphosphorylated tau protein. Aggregates of mutated huntingtin, alpha-synuclein, or unidentified protein in motor neuron disease type of frontotemporal dementia were always negative. These findings indicate that calpain 2 activation is not a general response to protein aggregation. In tauopathies, more pathological inclusions were labeled for hyperphosphorylated tau than for activated calpain 2. The extent of colocalization varied in both a disease-specific and cell-type specific manner. The active form of calpain 2 was detected in 50-75% of tau neurofibrillary pathology in Alzheimer's disease, Alzheimer neurofibrillary changes and Down's syndrome, as well as in the accompanying Alzheimer-type tau pathology in diffuse Lewy bodies disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, and corticobasal degeneration. For glial cells, only 10-25% of tuft-shaped astrocytes, glial plaques, or coiled bodies contained activated calpain 2. The majority of Pick bodies were negative. The association of calpain 2 activation with hyperphosphorylated tau might be the result of an attempt by the calpain proteolytic system to degrade the tau protein aggregates. Alternatively, calpain 2 could be directly involved in tau hyperphosphorylation by modulating protein kinase activities. Overall, these results provide evidence of the important role of the calpain proteolytic system in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases with tau neurofibrillary pathology.

Genetika. 2004 Jun;40(6):850-2. Ile105Val polymorphism in exon 5 of glutathione S-transferase (GSTP1) gene was examined in a group of patients with motor neuron disease (MND) and control sample. No statistically significant differences in the allele and genotype frequency distributions between the samples examined were demonstrated. We conclude that Ile105Val polymorphism is not associated with the risk of the disease development in the patients from Russia with sporadic form of MND.
motor_neuron_disease	DLDH	Negative	PMID:16317257	Katsuse O, Dickson DW: Ubiquitin immunohistochemistry of frontotemporal lobar degeneration differentiates cases with and without motor neuron disease. Alzheimer Dis Assoc Disord. 2005 Oct-Dec;19 Suppl 1:S37-43. Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) without tau pathology is clinically and pathologically heterogeneous. The present report describes the neuropathology of 52 brains with FTLD without tau pathology compared with 10 brains of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) without dementia using ubiquitin immunohistochemistry. The 52 cases were classified into 47 cases of FTLD with motor neuron disease (MND)-type inclusions but without MND (FTLD-MNI), three cases of FTLD with MND (FTLD-MND), and two cases of dementia lacking distinctive histopathology (DLDH) based on the features of ubiquitin-immunoreactive (ubiquitin-ir) structures in the caudate, frontotemporal cortices and dentate fascia, and presence or absence of neuronal loss in lower motor neurons. Many ubiquitin-ir neuronal inclusions and neurites in the caudate nucleus, frontotemporal cortices, and ubiquitin-ir crescent-or ring-shaped neuronal inclusions in the dentate fascia characterized FTLD-MNI. Ubiquitin-ir neuronal intranuclear inclusions (NII) were observed in 26 of 43 cases and associated with many neurites in the caudate nucleus as well as a familial history in most cases. A subset of cases had Pick-body-like inclusions in the dentate fascia and caudate nucleus with paucity of neuritic pathology and no NII; another had crescent-shaped inclusions in the dentate fascia and neuritic pathology with NII in the caudate. FTLD with MND was characterized by a few or no ubiquitin-ir inclusions in the caudate nucleus and frontotemporal cortices and ubiquitin-ir granular inclusions in the dentate fascia, as well as loss of lower motor neurons. These features were similar to ALS, but different from FTLD-MNI. The findings suggest that FTLD-MNI has a different pathogenesis from FTLD-MND and ALS.

Epub 2005 Jul 20. This is a clinicopathologic study of a prospective, clinic-based cohort of patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD)/Pick complex, who were followed to autopsy. A total of 60 patients with the clinical syndromes of the behavioural variant of FTD (FTD-bv) (n = 32), primary progressive aphasia (PPA) (n = 22), corticobasal degeneration syndrome (CBDS) (n = 4) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) (n = 2) at onset, referred to a cognitive neurology clinic who had subsequent post-mortem examination were included. The most common histological variety was motor neurone disease type inclusion (MNDI) (n = 18), followed by corticobasal degeneration (CBD) (n = 12), then Pick's disease (n = 6), dementia lacking distinctive histology (DLDH) (n = 6) and PSP (n = 3). Others fulfilled the histological criteria for Alzheimer's disease combined with glial pathology (n = 6), Alzheimer's disease only (n = 4), Lewy body variant (n = 2), prion disease (n = 1), vascular dementia (n = 1) and undetermined (n = 1). The most common first syndrome among the MNDI and DLDH (tau negative) pathologies was FTD-bv, but subsequently progressive aphasia (PA), occasionally CBDS and semantic dementia also developed. Tau positive histologies of CBD, PSP and Pick bodies were most frequently associated with PPA onset or CBDS/PSP, but behavioural symptoms were also common. Age of onset was earlier in tau negative cases, but the duration of illness and gender distribution were about the same in all histological variants. Although the tau negative and positive histologies are predicted to some extent by the clinical onset, the extent of the overlap and the convergence of the syndromes in the course of the disease argue in favour of maintaining the clinical and pathological varieties under a single umbrella.
motor_neuron_disease	DLDH	Negative	PMID:15892300	Mott RT, Dickson DW, Trojanowski JQ, Zhukareva V, Lee VM, Forman M, Van Deerlin V, Ervin JF, Wang DS, Schmechel DE, Hulette CM: Neuropathologic, biochemical, and molecular characterization of the frontotemporal dementias. J Neuropathol Exp Neurol. 2005 May;64(5):420-8. The frontotemporal dementias (FTDs) are a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative disorders that are characterized clinically by dementia, personality changes, language impairment, and occasionally extrapyramidal movement disorders. Historically, the diagnosis and classification of FTDs has been fraught with difficulties, especially with regard to establishing a consensus on the neuropathologic diagnosis. Recently, an international group of scientists participated in a consensus conference to develop such neuropathologic criteria. They recommended a diagnostic classification scheme that incorporated a biochemical analysis of the insoluble tau isoform composition, as well as ubiquitin immunohistochemistry. The use and reliability of this classification system has yet to be examined. In this study, we evaluated 21 cases of FTD. Using traditional histochemical stains and tau protein and ubiquitin immunohistochemistry, we separated each case into one of the following categories: classic Pick disease (PiD; n = 7), corticobasal degeneration (CBD; n = 5), dementia lacking distinctive histopathologic features (DLDH; n = 4), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP; n = 2), frontotemporal lobar degeneration with motor neuron disease or motor neuron disease-type inclusions (FTLD-MND/MNI; n = 2), and neurofibrillary tangle dementia (NFTD; n = 1). Additionally, we independently categorized each case by the insoluble tau isoform pattern, including 3R (n = 5), 4R (n = 7), 3R/4R (n = 3), and no insoluble tau (n = 6). As suggested by the proposed diagnostic scheme, we found that the insoluble tau isoform patterns correlated strongly with the independently derived histopathologic diagnoses (p CBD (71%) or PSP (29%). Cases with both 3R and 4R tau were either a combination of PiD and Alzheimer disease (67%) or NFTD (33%). Finally, cases with no insoluble tau were either DLDH (67%) or FTLD-MND/MNI (33%). To further characterize these cases, we also performed quantitative Western blots for soluble tau, APOE genotyping, and, in selected cases, tau gene sequencing. We show that soluble tau is reduced in DLDH and FTLD-MND/MNI and that APOE4 is overrepresented in PiD and DLDH. We also identified a new family with the R406W mutation and pathology consistent with NFTD. This study validates the recently proposed diagnostic criteria and forms a framework for further refinement of this classification scheme.

Am J Otolaryngol. 2002 May-Jun;23(3):169-72. Myasthenia gravis is a motor neuron disease caused by the presence of antibodies against acetylcholine receptors that interfere with the proper function of the neuromuscular junction. Twenty percent of patients with myasthenia gravis present some type of bulbar deficits such as rhinolalia, dysphagia or dysphonia as the first symptom of disease. We report 5 patients with deficits that illustrate different aspects of the disease. Our role as otolaryngologists is to establish a diagnosis or to provide a solution for the respiratory failure caused by chronic aspiration.

Myasthenia gravis is a motor neuron disease caused by the presence of antibodies against acetylcholine receptors that interfere with proper functioning of the neuromuscular junction. Twenty percent of patients show bulbar involvement as the first indication of disease, with symptoms such as rhinolalia, dysphagia or phonasthenia. We report the cases of five patients for which our intervention was requested. We were involved in capacities ranging from the interpretation of the first symptom of disease to assessment of surgical possibilities for the treatment of chronic aspiration and severe respiratory symptoms in patients with major dysphagia. We review the scant bibliography published in the last five years.

Neuropathology. 2005 Dec;25(4):371-80. We have used adult rat peripheral nerve avulsion models to evaluate the effects of neuroprotective molecules on motoneuron degeneration. The right facial nerves of adult Fischer 344 male rats were avulsed and adenoviral vectors encoding glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), transforming growth factor-beta2 (TGFbeta2), and growth inhibitory factor (GIF) were injected into the facial canal. The treatment with the vectors significantly prevented the loss of lesioned facial motoneurons, improved choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) immunoreactivity and suppressed the induction of nitric oxide synthase activity in these neurons. In separate experiments, animals were orally administered a solution of a neuroprotective compound T-588 after avulsion. Both free oral administration and oral tube administration of T-588 improved the survival of injured motoneurons and ameliorated their ChAT immunoreactivity. These results indicate that the gene transfer of GDNF, BDNF, TGFbeta2, and GIF and oral administration of T-588 may prevent the degeneration of motoneurons in adult humans with motoneuron injury and motor neuron diseases.
motor_neuron_disease	GDNF	Positive	PMID:12699624	Ferri A, Sanes JR, Coleman MP, Cunningham JM, Kato AC: Inhibiting axon degeneration and synapse loss attenuates apoptosis and disease progression in a mouse model of motoneuron disease. Curr Biol. 2003 Apr 15;13(8):669-73. Apoptosis is a hallmark of motoneuron diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) [1]. In a widely used mouse model of motoneuron disease (progressive motor neuronopathy or pmn) [2-4], transgenic expression of the anti-apoptotic bcl-2 gene [5] or treatment with glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor [6] prevents the apoptosis of the motoneuron soma; however, they were unable to affect the life span of the animals. The goal of the present work was to determine whether the pmn phenotype could be rescued by means of a gene that inhibits axon degeneration. For this reason, the pmn mice were crossed with mice bearing the dominant Wlds ("slow Wallerian degeneration") mutation, which slows axon degeneration and synapse loss [7-9]. We show here that the Wlds gene product attenuates symptoms, extends life span, prevents axon degeneration, rescues motoneuron number and size, and delays retrograde transport deficits in pmn/pmn mice. These results suggest new pathogenic mechanisms and therapeutic avenues for motoneuron diseases.

Hum Cell. 2001 Mar;14(1):7-15. Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) strongly supports the survival of injured neonatal motoneurons, suggesting its potential uses in the treatment of motoneuron injury and motor neuron diseases. We examined neuroprotective effects of an adenoviral vector encoding GDNF (AxCAhGDNF) on the survival of lesioned adult rat facial and spinal motoneurons. The facial nerve or the seventh cervical segment (C7) ventral and dorsal roots of 3 month-old Fischer 344 male rats were avulsed and removed from the stylomastoid or vertebral foramen, respectively, and AxCALacZ (adenovirus containing beta-galactosidase gene), AxCAhGDNF, or PBS was inoculated in the lesioned foramen. One week after the avulsion and treatment with AxCALacZ, the animal showed expression of beta-galactosidase activity in lesioned facial and spinal motoneurons. Animals avulsed and treated with AxCAhGDNF showed intense immunolabeling for GDNF in lesioned facial and spinal motoneurons and expression of virus-induced human GDNF mRNA transcripts in the lesioned brain stem and spinal cord tissues. The treatment with AxCAhGDNF after avulsion significantly prevented the loss of lesioned facial and C7 spinal motoneurons, ameliorated choline acetyltransferase immunoreactivity, and suppressed the activity of nitric oxide synthase in these neurons. These results indicate that the adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of GDNF may prevent the degeneration of motoneurons in adult humans with motoneuron injury and motor neuron diseases.

We examined neuroprotective effect of human GDNF encoded by an adenovirus vector (AxCAhGDNF) on the death of lesioned adult rat spinal motoneurons. The seventh cervical segment (C7) ventral and dorsal roots and dorsal root ganglia of adult Fisher 344 rats were avulsed, and AxCAhGDNF, AxCALacZ (adenovirus encoding beta-galactosidase gene) or PBS was inoculated in C7 vertebral foramen. One week after the avulsion and treatment with AxCALacZ, the animals showed expression of beta-galactosidase activity in lesioned spinal motoneurons. Animals avulsed and treated with AxCAhGDNF showed intense immunolabeling for GDNF in lesioned spinal motoneurons and expression of virus-induced human GDNF mRNA transcripts in the lesioned spinal cord tissue. Nissl-stained cell counts revealed that the treatment with AxCAhGDNF significantly prevented the loss of lesioned ventral horn motoneurons 2 to 8 weeks after avulsion, as compared to AxCALacZ or PBS treatment. Furthermore, the AxCAhGDNF treatment ameliorated choline acetyltransferase immunoreactivity in the lesioned motoneurons after avulsion. These results indicate that the adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of GDNF may prevent the degeneration of motoneurons in adult humans with spinal cord injury and motor neuron diseases.

Neurochem Res. 1999 Jun;24(6):785-90. The mRNA expression levels of GDNF, GDNFR-alpha and RET were examined in the muscles of amyotrophic lateral screlosis (ALS) and X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA). GDNF mRNA levels were significantly elevated to variable extent in the diseased muscles compared to control muscles, although they were not specific to the type of the diseases. The diseased muscles also have a different expression pattern of GDNF mRNA isoforms from controls. GDNF mRNA expression, however, tended to reduce in advanced muscle pathology. On the other hand, GDNFR-alpha mRNA levels were not changed significantly on expression levels in the diseased muscles. In situ hybridization study revealed that GDNF and GDNFR-alpha mRNAs were localized in subsarcolemmal space of muscle cells. RET mRNA was not detected in control nor diseased muscles. These results suggest that the elevated muscle GDNF acts as a trophic signal for motor neurons of motor neuron diseases, implying a possible therapeutic implication of GDNF to this type of diseases.
motor_neuron_disease	alpha-internexin	Negative	PMID:15170578	Cairns NJ, Uryu K, Bigio EH, Mackenzie IR, Gearing M, Duyckaerts C, Yokoo H, Nakazato Y, Jaros E, Perry RH, Arnold SE, Lee VM, Trojanowski JQ: alpha-Internexin aggregates are abundant in neuronal intermediate filament inclusion disease (NIFID) but rare in other neurodegenerative diseases. Acta Neuropathol. 2004 Sep;108(3):213-23. Epub 2004 May 28. Abnormal neuronal aggregates of alpha-internexin and the three neurofilament (NF) subunits, NF-L, NF-M, and NF-H have recently been identified as the pathological hallmarks of neuronal intermediate filament (IF) inclusion disease (NIFID), a novel neurological disease of early onset with a variable clinical phenotype including frontotemporal dementia, pyramidal and extrapyramidal signs. alpha-Internexin, a class IV IF protein, a major component of inclusions in NIFID, has not previously been identified as a component of the pathological protein aggregates of any other neurodegenerative disease. Therefore, to determine the specificity of this protein, alpha-internexin immunohistochemistry was undertaken on cases of NIFID, non-tau frontotemporal dementias, motor neuron disease, alpha-synucleinopathies, tauopathies, and normal aged control brains. Our results indicate that class IV IF proteins are present within the pleomorphic inclusions of all cases of NIFID. Small subsets of abnormal neuronal inclusions in Alzheimer's disease, Lewy body diseases, and motor neuron disease also contain epitopes of alpha-internexin. Thus, alpha-internexin is a major component of the neuronal inclusions in NIFID and a relatively minor component of inclusions in other neurodegenerative diseases. The discovery of alpha-internexin in neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions implicates novel mechanisms of pathogenesis in NIFID and other neurological diseases with pathological filamentous neuronal inclusions.

Genetika. 2006 Jan;42(1):104-9. Polymorphisms of the genes of the glutamatergic system EAAT2, GRIA1, and GRIA2 have been analyzed in patients with sporadic motor neuron disease (MND) from Russia. The disease is not associated with polymorphic alleles of the genes studied, which indicates that EAAT2, GRIA1, and GRIA2 play an insignificant role in the pathogenesis of sporadic MND.

Ann N Y Acad Sci. 2005 Aug;1053:269-86. To reveal whether increased Ca2+ permeability of glutamate AMPA channels triggered by the transgene for GluR-B (N) induces decline in motor functions and neurodegeneration in the spinal cord, we evaluated growth, motor coordination, and spinal reflexes in transgenic GluR-B (N) and wild-type (wt) mice. To reveal whether the transgenic GluR-B (N) expression aggravates the course of motoneuron disease in SOD1 mice, we mated heterozygous GluR-B (N) and SOD1 [C57BL6Ico-TgN (hSOD1-G93A) 1Gur] mice to generate double-transgenic progeny. The phenotypic sequelae in mice carrying mutations were evaluated by monitoring growth, motor coordination, and survival. Neuronal degeneration was assessed by morphological and stereological analysis of spinal cord and brain. We found that transgenic expression in mice of GluR-B (N)-containing glutamate AMPA receptors with increased Ca2+ permeability leads to a late-onset degeneration of neurons in the spinal cord and decline of motor functions. Neuronal death progressed over the entire life span, but manifested clinically in late adulthood, resembling the course of a slow neurodegenerative disorder. Additional transgenic expression of mutated human SOD1 accelerated disease progression, aggravated severity of motor decline, and decreased survival. These observations reveal that moderate, but persistently elevated Ca2+ influx via glutamate AMPA channels causes degeneration of spinal motoneurons and motor decline over the span of life. These features resemble the course of sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in humans and suggest that modified function of glutamate AMPA channels may be causally linked to pathogenesis of ALS.

J Neurosci. 2006 Nov 1;26(44):11397-402. An increase in the expression of the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) has been observed in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and in the mice models of the disease. TNF-alpha is a potent activator of macrophages and microglia and, under certain conditions, can induce or exacerbate neuronal cell death. Here, we assessed the contribution of TNF-alpha in motor neuron disease in mice overexpressing mutant superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) genes linked to familial ALS. This was accomplished by the generation of mice expressing SOD1 (G37R) or SOD1 (G93A) mutants in the context of TNF-alpha gene knock out. Surprisingly, the absence of TNF-alpha did not affect the lifespan or the extent of motor neuron loss in SOD1 transgenic mice. These results provide compelling evidence indicating that TNF-alpha does not directly contribute to motor neuron degeneration caused by SOD1 mutations.

Brain Res. 2006 Jun 22;1096(1):180-95. Epub 2006 Jun 5. Transgenic mice expressing a mutated human Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) gene develop a motor neuron disease similar to familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FALS). While the histopathology and the inflammatory reactions in the spinal cord of these mice are well described, their spatiotemporal extension into brain areas and the relationship between degenerative and inflammatory events remain obscure. In the present study, we investigated the time course and extent of degenerative changes and inflammatory reactions in the CNS during progression of the disease in a transgenic FALS model, the SOD1-G93A mouse with histological and immunohistochemical methods. Compared to non-transgenic littermates, the SOD1-G93A transgenics developed widespread degeneration in both motor and extra-motor regions up to telencephalic regions, including the cerebral cortex but sparing distinct regions like the striatum and hippocampus. We provide evidence that these degenerative processes are accompanied by intense inflammatory reactions in the brain, which spatiotemporally correlate with degeneration and comprise besides strong astro- and microgliotic reactions also an influx of peripheral immune cells such as T-lymphocytes and dendritic cells. Both degeneration and inflammatory reactions spread caudocranially, starting at 2 months in the spinal cord and reaching the telencephalon at 5 months of age. Since the corticospinal tract lacked any signs of degeneration, we conclude that the upper and the lower motor neurons degenerate independently of each other.

The discovery of missense mutations in the gene coding for the Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) in subsets of familial cases was rapidly followed by the generation of transgenic mice expressing various forms of SOD1 mutants. The mice overexpressing high levels of mutant SOD1 mRNAs do develop motor neuron disease but unraveling the mechanisms of pathogenesis has been very challenging. Studies with mouse lines suggest that the toxicity of mutant SOD1 is unrelated to copper-mediated catalysis but rather to propensity of a subfraction of mutant SOD1 proteins to form misfolded protein species and aggregates. However, the mechanism of toxicity of SOD1 mutants remains to be elucidated. Involvement of cytoskeletal components in ALS pathogenesis is supported by several mouse models of motor neuron disease with neurofilament abnormalities and with genetic defects in microtubule-based transport. Here, we describe how transgenic mouse models have been used for understanding pathogenic pathways of motor neuron disease and for pre-clinical drug testing.
motor_neuron_disease	SOD1	Positive	PMID:16184763	Batulan Z, Nalbantoglu J, Durham HD: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs differentially affect the heat shock response in cultured spinal cord cells. Neuromuscul Disord. 2007 Jul 9;. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been shown to amplify the heat shock response in cell lines by increasing the binding of heat shock transcription factor-1 to heat shock elements within heat shock gene promoters. Because overexpression of the inducible heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) was neuroprotective in a culture model of motor neuron disease, this study investigated whether NSAIDs induce Hsp70 and confer cytoprotection in motor neurons of dissociated spinal cord cultures exposed to various stresses. Two NSAIDs, sodium salicylate and niflumic acid, lowered the temperature threshold for induction of Hsp70 in glia but failed to do so in motor neurons. At concentrations that increased Hsp70 in heat shocked glial cells, sodium salicylate failed to delay death of motor neurons exposed to hyperthermia, paraquat-mediated oxidative stress, and glutamate excitotoxicity. Neither sodium salicylate nor the cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, niflumic acid, protected motor neurons from the toxicity of mutated Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD-1) linked to a familial form of the motor neuron disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Thus, treatment with 2 types of NSAIDs failed to overcome the high threshold for the activation of heat shock response in motor neurons.

Neuron. 2004 Jul 8;43(1):5-17. Laser microdissection allows removal of individual cells for DNA extraction, but obtaining reliably amplified DNA from the small numbers of cells that survive neurodegenerative diseases can be difficult. We therefore tested a recently-available technique to amplify genomic DNA to see if it could reliably detect a mutation in nervous system cells. Fifty cortical motor neurons were removed by laser microdissection from cases of motor neuron disease both with and without known mutations in the gene for superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1). DNA was extracted and amplified with a linear genomic amplification kit (GenomiPhitrade mark). The PCR product of exon 4 of SOD1 from this DNA was then sequenced. The GenomiPhi kit amplified the extracted DNA approximately 70 times. When exon 4 of SOD1 from this DNA was amplified by PCR the E100G SOD1 mutation could be identified on sequencing. No errors in replication were found. In conclusion, the GenomiPhi method of genomic DNA amplification appears to result in reliable replication of mutations in neurons. This technique can be used to obtain increased amounts of genomic DNA to study mutations within cells of the nervous system.

Nihon Shinkei Seishin Yakurigaku Zasshi. 2001 Feb;21(1):21-25. Familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FALS) has been modeled in transgenic mice by introducing mutated versions of human genomic DNA encompassing the entire gene for Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1). In this setting, the transgene is expressed throughout the body and results in mice that faithfully recapitulate many pathological and behavioral aspects of FALS. By contrast, transgenic mice made by introducing recombinant vectors, encoding cDNA genes, that target mutant SOD1 expression to motor neurons, only, or astrocytes, only, do not develop disease. Here, we report that mice transgenic for human SOD1 cDNA with the G37R mutation, driven by the mouse prion promoter, develop motor neuron disease. In this model, expression of the transgene is highest in CNS (both neurons and astrocytes) and muscle. The gene was not expressed in cells of the macrophage lineage. Although the highest expressing hemizygous transgenic mice fail to develop disease by 20 months of age, mice homozygous for the transgene show typical ALS-like phenotypes as early as 7 months of age. Spinal cords and brain stems from homozygous animals with motor neuron disease were found to contain aggregated species of mutant SOD1. The establishment of this SOD1-G37R cDNA transgenic model indicates that expression of mutant SOD1 proteins in the neuromuscular unit is sufficient to cause motor neuron disease. The expression levels required to induce disease coincide with the levels required to induce the formation of SOD1 aggregates.

Brain. 2005 Jul;128(Pt 7):1686-706. Epub 2005 May 4. Familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FALS) is caused, in 20% of cases, by mutations in the Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase gene (SOD1). Although motor neuron injury occurs through a toxic gain of function, the precise mechanism (s) remains unclear. Using an established NSC34 cellular model for SOD1-associated FALS, we investigated the effects of mutant SOD1 specifically in cells modelling the vulnerable cell population, the motor neurons, without contamination from non-neuronal cells present in CNS. Using gene expression profiling, 268 transcripts were differentially expressed in the presence of mutant human G93A SOD1. Of these, 197 were decreased, demonstrating that the presence of mutant SOD1 leads to a marked degree of transcriptional repression. Amongst these were a group of antioxidant response element (ARE) genes encoding phase II detoxifying enzymes and antioxidant response proteins (so-called 'programmed cell life' genes), the expression of which is regulated by the transcription factor NRF2. We provide evidence that dysregulation of Nrf2 and the ARE, coupled with reduced pentose phosphate pathway activity and decreased generation of NADPH, represent significant and hitherto unrecognized components of the toxic gain of function of mutant SOD1. Other genes of interest significantly altered in the presence of mutant SOD1 include several previously implicated in neurodegeneration, as well as genes involved in protein degradation, the immune response, cell death/survival and the heat shock response. Preliminary studies on isolated motor neurons from SOD1-associated motor neuron disease cases suggest key genes are also differently expressed in the human disease.

Neurobiol Dis. 2002 Jul;10(2):128-38. Mutation of Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) contributes to a portion of the cases of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FALS). We previously reported on a FALS family whose members had a mutant form of SOD1 characterized by a 2-base pair (bp) deletion at codon 126 of the SOD1 gene. To investigate the cellular consequences of this mutation, we produced transgenic mice that expressed normal and mutated copies of human SOD1: wild-type SOD1 (W), wild-type SOD1 with a FLAG epitope at C-terminal (WF), mutated SOD1 with the 2-bp deletion (D), and SOD1 with the 2-bp deletion with FLAG (DF). The mice heterozygotic for the human mutated SOD1 (D and DF) showed distinct ALS-like motor symptoms, whereas the mice heterozygotic for the normal SOD1 (W and WF) mice did not. Homozygotes of D and DF lines showed the ALS symptoms at an earlier age and died earlier than the heterozygotes. By Northern blot analysis, the mRNAs for all human SOD1s were confirmed in these lines. All the human SOD1 proteins, except the D mutant, were detectable by immunoblot. The D protein was only confirmed when it was concentrated by immunoprecipitation. Neuropathologically, loss of spinal motor neurons and reactive gliosis were common features in the symptomatic lines. The remaining motor neurons in these mice also exhibited eosinophilic inclusions. The biochemical and pathological characteristics of these mice are quite similar to those of human FALS patients with same mutation. This intriguing model will provide an important source of information of the pathogenesis of FALS.

Zh Nevrol Psikhiatr Im S S Korsakova. 2003;103(11):46-52. Fifty-one blood samples of Russian patients with sporadic motor neuron disease were examined for mutations in Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD-1) gene. One female patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) was heterozygous for G12R mutation. This patient suffered from ALS with cervical cord onset, pyramidal variant and fast progression. Mutation was also detected in her healthy son. Earlier, such mutation was described in 5 Italian patients with slow progressive ALS. Also, D90A SOD-1 gene associated haplotypes of the female ALS patients previously examined by the authors have been analyzed. A homozygous female patient with ALS was characterized by typical lumbar onset and extremely slow progression, as well as a female patient with heterozygous mutation and moderate progression carried so-called "Scandinavian" haplotype. To our knowledge, it is the first report on the finding of the haplotype considered as a "protective" one in the subjects heterozygous for D90A mutation with clinical symptoms of ALS. Mechanisms of "protective" influence of this haplotype on ALS course are not yet elucidated. Our finding suggests that the presence of "Scandinavian" haplotype does not completely protect from the disease development in patients exposed to other more pathogenic causative factors. This assumption is in line with modern conceptions on motor neuron disease as a complicated multifactor disorder.

Neurology. 1999 Oct 12;53(6):1239-46. INTRODUCTION: Reduction in the levels of whole-blood serotonin is a common feature of Down syndrome (DS) individuals and transgenic mice overexpressing wild-type SOD1. Administration of the metabolic precursor 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) leads to reversal of both serotonin deficits and hypotonia in humans. The effect of 5-HTP treatment on the progression of motor neuron disease in mutant SOD1 mice was examined. METHODS: Pre-disease transgenic SOD1 G93A mice and wild-type littermates were systemically administered 5-HTP thrice weekly (0, 5 or 50 mg/kg). Animal weights, locomotor function and survival were recorded weekly. Plasma serotonin levels were measured post-mortem. RESULTS: Treatment with 5-HTP significantly delayed hindlimb weakness and mortality in SOD1 G93A mice in a dose-dependent manner. Wild-type mice were not adversely affected by 5-HTP administration. Baseline serotonin levels did not differ between wild-type and ALS mice. Blood platelet serotonin levels increased proportionally with dose. CONCLUSIONS: Increased blood serotonin by administration of 5-HTP in SOD1 G93A mice led to improved locomotor function and survival. A role for serotonin metabolism in mice with elevated SOD1 expression and motor neuron disease is suggested by these studies.

J Neurosci Res. 2003 Apr 1;72(1):54-64. We examined neuroprotective effects of recombinant adenoviral vectors encoding glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), cardiotrophin-1 (CT1), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1), and transforming growth factor-beta2 (TGFbeta2) on lesioned adult rat facial motoneurons. The right facial nerves of adult Fischer 344 male rats were avulsed and removed from the stylomastoid foramen, and adenoviral vectors were injected into the facial canal. Animals avulsed and treated with adenovirus encoding GDNF, BDNF, CNTF, CT1, IGF1 and TGFbeta2 showed intense immunolabeling for these factors in lesioned facial motoneurons, respectively, indicating adenoviral induction of the neurotrophic factors in these neurons. The treatment with adenovirus encoding GDNF, BDNF, or TGFbeta2 after avulsion significantly prevented the loss of lesioned facial motoneurons, improved choline acetyltransferase immunoreactivity and prevented the induction of nitric oxide synthase activity in these neurons. The treatment with adenovirus encoding CNTF, CT1 or IGF1, however, failed to protect these neurons after avulsion. These results indicate that the gene transfer of GDNF and BDNF and TGFbeta2 but not CNTF, CT1 or IGF1 may prevent the degeneration of motoneurons in adult humans with motoneuron injury and motor neuron diseases.

J Clin Invest. 2007 Mar;117(3):659-71. Epub 2007 Feb 22. The inherited motor neuron disease spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is caused by mutation of the telomeric survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene with retention of the centromeric SMN2 gene. We sought to establish whether the potent and specific hydroxamic acid class of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors activates SMN2 gene expression in vivo and modulates the SMA disease phenotype when delivered after disease onset. Single intraperitoneal doses of 10 mg/kg trichostatin A (TSA) in nontransgenic and SMA model mice resulted in increased levels of acetylated H3 and H4 histones and modest increases in SMN gene expression. Repeated daily doses of TSA caused increases in both SMN2-derived transcript and SMN protein levels in neural tissues and muscle, which were associated with an improvement in small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) assembly. When TSA was delivered daily beginning on P5, after the onset of weight loss and motor deficit, there was improved survival, attenuated weight loss, and enhanced motor behavior. Pathological analysis showed increased myofiber size and number and increased anterior horn cell size. These results indicate that the hydroxamic acid class of HDAC inhibitors activates SMN2 gene expression in vivo and has an ameliorating effect on the SMA disease phenotype when administered after disease onset.

Neurology. 2006 Oct 10;67(7):1147-50. Epub 2006 Aug 23. BACKGROUND: SMN1 gene deletions cause spinal muscular atrophy, and SMN2 gene deletions have been associated with sporadic lower motor neuron diseases. OBJECTIVES: To study the frequency of abnormal SMN1 gene copy numbers and to determine whether SMN2 gene modulates the risk of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or the duration of evolution. METHOD: The authors studied SMN1 and SMN2 genes in 600 patients with sporadic ALS and 621 controls using a quantitative PCR method. RESULTS: The authors found an association of ALS with an abnormal copy number (one or three copies) of SMN1 gene (p association with SMN2 copy numbers and no effect of SMN2 copies on the duration of evolution in ALS independently of SMN1 copy number. CONCLUSION: Abnormal SMN1 gene copy numbers are a genetic risk factor in sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. There was no modulator effect of the SMN2 gene.

Ann Neurol. 2003 Nov;54(5):647-54. Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an inherited motor neuron disease caused by mutation of the telomeric copy of the survival motor neuron gene (SMN1). Although a centromeric copy of the survival motor neuron gene (SMN2) is retained in all patients with SMA, it differs from SMN1 at a critical nucleotide such that the majority of SMN2 transcripts lack exon 7 and encode an unstable, truncated protein. Here, we show that valproic acid increases levels of exon 7-containing SMN transcript and SMN protein in type I SMA patient-derived fibroblast cell lines. Valproic acid may increase SMN levels both by activating the SMN promoter and by preventing exon 7 skipping in SMN transcripts. Valproic acid and related compounds warrant further investigation as potential treatment for SMA.

Muscle Nerve. 2003 Oct;28(4):432-7. Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a motor neuron disease caused by mutations of the survival motor neuron 1 gene (SMN1). No curative treatment is available. Mutant mice carrying homozygous deletion of Smn exon 7 directed to neurons display a degenerative process of motor neurons similar to that found in human SMA. To test whether riluzole, which exhibits neurotrophic properties, might have a protective role in SMA, mutant mice were treated with it after the onset of the degenerative process. Riluzole improved median survival and exerted a protective effect against aberrant cytoskeletal organization of motor synaptic terminals but not against loss of proximal axons. These results demonstrate that the disease course of SMA can be attenuated after the onset of neuromuscular defects and may warrant further investigation in a therapeutic trial in SMA.
motor_neuron_disease	SMN1	Positive	PMID:12165565	Hofmann Y, Wirth B: hnRNP-G promotes exon 7 inclusion of survival motor neuron (SMN) via direct interaction with Htra2-beta1. Hum Mol Genet. 2002 Aug 15;11(17):2037-49. Proximal spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a common motor neuron disease caused by homozygous loss of the survival motor neuron gene (SMN1). SMN2, a nearly identical copy of the gene and present in all SMA patients, fails to provide protection from SMA, due to the disruption of an exonic splicing enhancer (ESE) by a single translationally silent nucleotide exchange, which causes alternative splicing of SMN2 exon 7. Identification of splicing factors that stimulate exon 7 inclusion and thereby produce sufficient amounts of full-length transcripts from the SMN2 gene is of great importance for therapy approaches. Here, by use of in vivo splicing assays, we identified the protein hnRNP-G and its paralogue RBM as two novel splicing factors that promote the inclusion of SMN2 exon 7. Moreover, hnRNP-G and RBM non-specifically bind RNA, but directly and specifically bind Htra2-beta1, an SR-like splicing factor which we have previously shown to stimulate inclusion of exon 7 through a direct interaction with the AG-rich ESE in SMN2 exon 7 pre-mRNA. By using deletion mutants of hnRNP-G, we show that the specific protein-protein interaction of hnRNP-G with Htra2-beta1 mediates the inclusion of SMN2 exon 7 rather than the non-specific interaction of hnRNP-G with SMN pre-mRNA. Additionally, we show for the first time that recombinant trans-acting splicing factors such as hnRNP-G and Htra2-beta1 are also effective on endogenous SMN2 transcripts and increase the endogenous SMN protein level. Finally, we suggest a model of how the exon 7 mRNA processing is regulated by the splicing factors identified so far.

Brain Res. 2002 Aug 2;945(2):160-73. Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an inherited motor neuron disease caused by mutations in the survival motor neuron gene (SMN1). While it has been shown that the SMN protein is involved in spliceosome biogenesis and pre-mRNA splicing, there is increasing evidence indicating that SMN may also perform important functions in the nucleolus. We demonstrate here through the use of a previously characterized polyclonal anti-SMN antibody, abSMN, that the SMN protein shows a striking colocalization with the nucleolar protein, fibrillarin, in both nucleoli and Cajal bodies/gems of primary neurons. Immunoblot analysis with antifibrillarin and two different anti-SMN antibodies reveals that SMN and fibrillarin also cofractionate in the insoluble protein fraction of cultured cell lysates. Immunoprecipitation experiments using whole cell extracts of HeLa cells and cultured neurons revealed that abSMN coprecipitated small amounts of the U3 small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) previously shown to be associated with fibrillarin in vivo. These studies raise the possibility that SMN may serve a function in rRNA maturation/ribosome synthesis similar to its role in spliceosome biogenesis.
motor_neuron_disease	SMN1	Positive	PMID:11313744	Sossi V, Giuli A, Vitali T, Tiziano F, Mirabella M, Antonelli A, Neri G, Brahe C: Premature termination mutations in exon 3 of the SMN1 gene are associated with exon skipping and a relatively mild SMA phenotype. Eur J Hum Genet. 2001 Feb;9(2):113-20. Autosomal recessive spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a common motor neuron disease caused by absence or mutation in the survival motor neuron (SMN1) gene. SNM1 and a nearly identical copy, SMN2, encode identical proteins, but SMN2 only produces a little full length protein due to alternative splicing. The level of functional SMN protein and the number of SMN2 genes correlate with the clinical phenotype ranging from severe to very mild. Here, we report on premature termination mutations in SMN1 exon 3 (425del5 and W102X) which induce skipping of the mutated exon. The novel nonsense mutation W102X was detected in two patients with a relatively mild phenotype who had only two copies of the SMN2 gene, a number that has previously been found associated with the severe form of SMA. We show that the shortened transcripts are translated into predicted in frame protein isoforms. Aminoglycoside treatment suppressed the nonsense mutation in cultured cells and abolished exon skipping. Fibroblasts from both patients show a high number of nuclear structures containing SMN protein (gems). These findings suggest that the protein isoform lacking the exon 3 encoded region contributes to the formation of the nuclear protein complex which may account for the milder clinical phenotype.
motor_neuron_disease	SMN1	Positive	PMID:11274309	Veldink JH, van den Berg LH, Cobben JM, Stulp RP, De Jong JM, Vogels OJ, Baas F, Wokke JH, Scheffer H: Homozygous deletion of the survival motor neuron 2 gene is a prognostic factor in sporadic ALS. Neurology. 2001 Mar 27;56(6):749-52. BACKGROUND: Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) results from mutations of the survival motor neuron (SMN) gene on chromosome 5. The SMN gene exists in two highly homologous copies, telomeric (SMN1) and centromeric (SMN2). SMA is caused by mutations in SMN1 but not SMN2. The clinical phenotype of SMA appears to be related to the expression of SMN2. Patients suffering from the milder forms of SMA carry more copies of the SMN2 gene compared with patients with more severe SMA. It is suggested that the SMN2 gene is translated into an at least partially functional protein that protects against loss of motor neurons. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether genetic mechanisms implicated in motor neuron death in SMA have a role in ALS. METHODS: The presence of deletions of exons 7 and 8 of SMN1 and SMN2 was determined in 110 patients with sporadic ALS and compared with 100 unaffected controls. RESULTS: The presence of a homozygous SMN2 deletion was overrepresented in patients with ALS compared with controls (16% versus 4%; OR, 4.4; 95% CI, 1.4 to 13.5). Patients with a homozygous SMN2 deletion had a shorter median time of survival (p SMN2 deletion was independently associated with survival time (p SMN1 were found. Carrier status of SMA appeared to be equally present in patients and controls (1 in 20). CONCLUSION: These results indicate that, similar to SMA, the SMN2 gene can act as a prognostic factor and may therefore be a phenotypic modifier in sporadic ALS. Increasing the expression of the SMN2 gene may provide a strategy for treatment of motor neuron disease.
motor_neuron_disease	SMN1	Positive	PMID:10615130	Hsieh-Li HM, Chang JG, Jong YJ, Wu MH, Wang NM, Tsai CH, Li H: A mouse model for spinal muscular atrophy. Nat Genet. 2000 Jan;24(1):66-70. The survival motor neuron gene is present in humans in a telomeric copy, SMN1, and several centromeric copies, SMN2. Homozygous mutation of SMN1 is associated with proximal spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a severe motor neuron disease characterized by early childhood onset of progressive muscle weakness. To understand the functional role of SMN1 in SMA, we produced mouse lines deficient for mouse Smn and transgenic mouse lines that expressed human SMN2. Smn-/- mice died during the peri-implantation stage. In contrast, transgenic mice harbouring SMN2 in the Smn-/- background showed pathological changes in the spinal cord and skeletal muscles similar to those of SMA patients. The severity of the pathological changes in these mice correlated with the amount of SMN protein that contained the region encoded by exon 7. Our results demonstrate that SMN2 can partially compensate for lack of SMN1. The variable phenotypes of Smn-/-SMN2 mice reflect those seen in SMA patients, providing a mouse model for this disease.
motor_neuron_disease	tubulin-specific-chaperone-E	Positive	PMID:12446740	Bommel H, Xie G, Rossoll W, Wiese S, Jablonka S, Boehm T, Sendtner M: Missense mutation in the tubulin-specific chaperone E (Tbce) gene in the mouse mutant progressive motor neuronopathy, a model of human motoneuron disease. J Cell Biol. 2002 Nov 25;159(4):563-9. Progressive motor neuronopathy (pmn) mutant mice have been widely used as a model for human motoneuron disease. Mice that are homozygous for the pmn gene defect appear healthy at birth but develop progressive motoneuron disease, resulting in severe skeletal muscle weakness and respiratory failure by postnatal week 3. The disease starts at the motor endplates, and then leads to axonal loss and finally to apoptosis of the corresponding cell bodies. We localized the genetic defect in pmn mice to a missense mutation in the tubulin-specific chaperone E (Tbce) gene on mouse chromosome 13. The human orthologue maps to chromosome 1q42.3. The Tbce gene encodes a protein (cofactor E) that is essential for the formation of primary alpha-tubulin and beta-tubulin heterodimeric complexes. Isolated motoneurons from pmn mutant mice exhibit shorter axons and axonal swelling with irregularly structured beta-tubulin and tau immunoreactivity. Thus, the pmn gene mutation provides the first genetic evidence that alterations in tubulin assembly lead to retrograde degeneration of motor axons, ultimately resulting in motoneuron cell death.
motor_neuron_disease	nerve-growth-factor	Positive	PMID:17188890	Domeniconi M, Hempstead BL, Chao MV: Pro-NGF secreted by astrocytes promotes motor neuron cell death. J Neural Transm Suppl. 2000;(60):247-59. It is well established that motor neurons depend for their survival on many trophic factors. In this study, we show that the precursor form of NGF (pro-NGF) can induce the death of motor neurons via engagement of the p75 neurotrophin receptor. The pro-apoptotic activity was dependent upon the presence of sortilin, a p75 co-receptor expressed on motor neurons. One potential source of pro-NGF is reactive astrocytes, which up-regulate the levels of pro-NGF in response to peroxynitrite, an oxidant and producer of free radicals. Indeed, motor neuron viability was sensitive to conditioned media from cultured astrocytes treated with peroxynitrite and this effect could be reversed using a specific antibody against the pro-domain of pro-NGF. These results are consistent with a role for activated astrocytes and pro-NGF in the induction of motor neuron death and suggest a possible therapeutic target for the treatment of motor neuron disease.
motor_neuron_disease	excitatory-amino-acid-transporter-1	Positive	PMID:11784698	Banner SJ, Fray AE, Ince PG, Steward M, Cookson MR, Shaw PJ: The expression of the glutamate re-uptake transporter excitatory amino acid transporter 1 (EAAT1) in the normal human CNS and in motor neurone disease: an immunohistochemical study. Neuroscience. 2002;109(1):27-44. A monoclonal antibody to excitatory amino acid transporter 1 (EAAT1) has been generated which robustly stains paraffin-embedded, formaldehyde-fixed as well as snap-frozen human post-mortem brain tissue. We have used this antibody to map the distribution of EAAT1 throughout normal human CNS tissue. In addition this antibody has been used to perform a semi-quantitative immunohistochemical analysis of the expression of EAAT1 in motor cortex and cervical cord tissue taken from motor neurone disease cases (n=17) and neurologically normal controls (n=12). By comparing the relative optical density measurements of identical regions of motor cortex and cervical spinal cord an increase in the expression levels of EAAT1 was observed in motor neurone disease tissue compared to the control tissue and in both motor cortex and cervical spinal cord (9-17% and 13-33% increases respectively). EAAT1 was observed to be the most abundant transporter in more "caudal" brain regions such as the diencephalon and brainstem and its expression in other regions was frequently more uniform than that of EAAT2. In the motor cortex, EAAT1 immunoreactivity was present in all grey matter laminae, with some staining of individual astrocytes in the white matter. In spinal cord, EAAT1 immunoreactivity was strongest in the substantia gelatinosa. In the ventral horn, motor neurones were surrounded with a dense rim of perisomatic EAAT1 immunoreactivity, and the neuropil showed diffuse staining. Additional studies using double-labelling immunocytochemistry demonstrated that astrocytic co-localisation of EAAT1 and EAAT2 may occasionally be seen, but was not widespread in the human CNS and that in general astrocytes were positive for either EAAT1 or EAAT2.These results demonstrate that the EAAT1 has a widespread abundance throughout all regions of the human CNS examined and that there exist discrete populations of astrocytes that are positive solely for either EAAT1 or EAAT2. Furthermore, there is evidence to suggest that altered EAAT1 expression in motor neurone disease follows a different pattern to the reported changes of EAAT2 expression in this condition, indicating that the role of glutamate transporters in the pathogenesis of motor neurone disease appears more complex than previously appreciated.
motor_neuron_disease	catalase	Negative	PMID:10486188	Reinholz MM, Merkle CM, Poduslo JF: Therapeutic benefits of putrescine-modified catalase in a transgenic mouse model of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Exp Neurol. 1999 Sep;159(1):204-16. Dominant mutations in the copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1) gene have been observed in 15-20% of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FALS) cases. The mechanism by which SOD1 mutations result in motor neuron degeneration in FALS mice partly involves oxidative damage and an increased peroxidase activity of the mutant SOD1. A new therapeutic approach designed to eliminate the substrate of this peroxidase activity was examined in two lines of transgenic mice expressing the FALS-linked mutation glycine to alanine (G93A). We investigated the ability of putrescine-modified catalase (PUT-CAT), an antioxidant enzyme that removes hydrogen peroxide and has increased permeability at the blood-brain barrier, to modify the time course of the SOD1 mutation-induced motor neuron disease in these FALS mice. Continuous, subcutaneous administration of PUT-CAT significantly delayed the age at which onset of clinical disease occurred (indicated by loss of splay and/or tremors of hindlimbs) in a high-expressor line of FALS transgenic mice. Intraperitoneal injection of PUT-CAT given two times per week also significantly delayed the onset of clinical disease in a low-expressor line of FALS mice. PUT-CAT also significantly delayed the age at which clinical weakness developed (quantified by measuring the shortening of stride length) in both lines of FALS animals. No significant changes were observed in the survival times of the high-expressor FALS mice in any of the treatment groups. However, a trend toward a prolongation of survival was observed in the PUT-CAT-treated low-expressor FALS mice. These results support the role of free radical-mediated damage in the cascade of events leading to motor neurodegeneration in FALS and indicate that PUT-CAT interacts with a critical step in this cascade to delay the onset of clinical disease as well as the development of clinical weakness in FALS transgenic mice.

J Neurol Sci. 2006 Feb 15;241(1-2):39-43. Epub 2005 Nov 21. We evaluated the specific IgG antibodies against heat shock proteins (HSPs) in cerebrospinal fluids (CSF) from patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). ELISA was employed to examine IgG antibodies against ten HSPs (HSP27, alphaA and alphaB crystallins, HSP60, CCT, Mycobacterium bovis HSP65, Escherichia coli GroEL, HSP70, HSC70 and HSP90) in CSF from 30 patients with MS, and 25 patients with motor neuron diseases (MND). Significantly higher antibody titers against HSP70 and HSC70 proteins were found in CSF obtained from patients with MS as compared with MND independent of CSF total protein, IgG concentrations and IgG indices, respectively. The antibody titers against HSP70 were indicated to be significantly higher in the progressive cases than in cases of remission. The results suggest that IgG antibodies against specific types of HSPs especially HSP70 family proteins (HSP70 and HSC70) in CSF may play an important role in the pathophysiology of MS through the modification of immune response and cytoprotective functions of molecular chaperons.
motor_neuron_disease	Dynein	Positive	PMID:17265455	El-Kadi AM, Soura V, Hafezparast M: Defective axonal transport in motor neuron disease. J Neurosci Res. 2007 Jan 30;. Several recent studies have highlighted the role of axonal transport in the pathogenesis of motor neuron diseases. Mutations in genes that control microtubule regulation and dynamics have been shown to cause motor neuron degeneration in mice and in a form of human motor neuron disease. In addition, mutations in the molecular motors dynein and kinesins and several proteins associated with the membranes of intracellular vesicles that undergo transport cause motor neuron degeneration in humans and mice. Paradoxically, evidence from studies on the legs at odd angles (Loa) mouse and a transgenic mouse model for human motor neuron disease suggest that partial limitation of the function of dynein may in fact lead to improved axonal transport in the transgenic mouse, leading to delayed disease onset and increased life span.

Amyotroph Lateral Scler. 2006 Mar;7(1):46-56. The cytoplasmic dynein-dynactin complex has been implicated in the aetiology of motor neuron degeneration in both mouse models and human forms of motor neuron disease. We have previously shown that mutations in the cytoplasmic dynein 1 heavy chain 1 gene (Dync1h1) are causal in a mouse model of late-onset motor neuron degeneration but have found no association of the homologous sites in human DYNC1H1 with human motor neuron disease. Here we extend these analyses to investigate the DYNC1H1 genomic locus to determine if it is associated with sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in a northern European-derived population. Among the 16 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) we examined, just two SNPs (rs2251644 and rs941793) were sufficient to tag the majority of haplotypic variation (r2 > or = 0.85) and these were tested in a case-control association study with 266 North American sporadic ALS patients and 225 matched controls. We found no association between genetic variation at DYNC1H1 and sporadic ALS (rs2251644; p = 0.538, rs941793; p = 0.204, haplotype; p = 0.956). In addition we investigated patterns of diversity at DYNC1H1 in Japanese and Cameroonian populations to establish the evolutionary history for this gene and observed reduced genetic diversity in the northern Europeans suggestive of selection at this locus.

Nat Genet. 2005 Jul;37(7):771-6. Epub 2005 Jun 26. Mutations that affect the dynein motor machinery are sufficient to cause motor neuron disease. It is not known why there are aggregates or inclusions in affected tissues in mice with such mutations and in most forms of human motor neuron disease. Here we identify a new mechanism of inclusion formation by showing that decreased dynein function impairs autophagic clearance of aggregate-prone proteins. We show that mutations of the dynein machinery enhanced the toxicity of the mutation that causes Huntington disease in fly and mouse models. Furthermore, loss of dynein function resulted in premature aggregate formation by mutant huntingtin and increased levels of the autophagosome marker LC3-II in both cell culture and mouse models, compatible with impaired autophagosome-lysosome fusion.

Amyotroph Lateral Scler Other Motor Neuron Disord. 2003 Sep;4(3):150-7. We have shown in a mouse model of motor neuron disease, the legs-at-odd-angles (Loa) mutant, and that mutations in the cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain gene (Dnchc1) cause motor neuron degeneration. Mice exhibiting the Loa phenotype suffer progressive loss of locomotor function and homozygous animals have neuronal inclusion bodies that are positive for SOD1, CDK5, neurofilament and ubiquitin proteins. As this phenotype models some aspects of human motor neuron degeneration disorders, we think there is a reasonable likelihood that dynein may be a causative gene or susceptibility factor in human motor neuron disease. Therefore we have screened exons of this gene in a set of human patients with familial forms of disparate motor neuron degeneration diseases, affecting both upper and lower motor neurons: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), and hereditary spastic paraplegia. As part of this study, we have determined that DNCHC1 is a large gene of 78 exons spanning 86 kb genomic length. We have focused on the exons known to be mutated in Loa, and in a very similar mouse mutation, cramping 1 (Cra1); both mutations result in loss of anterior horn cells. The exons studied are highly conserved in a wide range of eukaryotes. We screened our patient samples by sequencing and although we detect single nucleotide polymorphisms, our results show these occur at the same frequency in our patient group as in control samples of unaffected individuals. Therefore we do not find any association between familial motor neuron disease and the genotypes presented here in the exons screened.

Brain. 2007 May;130(Pt 5):1375-85. Epub 2007 Mar 14. TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) is a major pathological protein of sporadic and familial frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin-positive, tau-negative inclusions (FTLD-U) with or without motor neuron disease (MND). Thus, TDP-43 defines a novel class of neurodegenerative diseases called TDP-43 proteinopathies. We performed ubiquitin and TDP-43 immunohistochemistry on 193 cases of familial and sporadic FTLD with or without MND. On selected cases, immunoelectron microscopy and biochemistry were performed. Clinically defined frontotemporal dementias (FTDs) included four groups: 1) familial FTD with mutations in progranulin (n = 36), valosin-containing protein (n = 5), charged multivesicular body protein 2B (n = 4), and linked to chromosome 9p (n = 7); 2) familial cases of FTD with unknown gene association (n = 29); 3) sporadic FTD (n = 72); and 4) familial and sporadic FTD with MND (n = 40). Our studies confirm that the spectrum of TDP-43 proteinopathies includes most cases of sporadic and familial FTLD-U with and without MND and expand this disease spectrum to include reported families with FTD linked to chromosome 9p but not FTD with charged multivesicular body protein 2B mutations. Thus, despite significant clinical, genetic, and neuropathological heterogeneity of FTLD-U, TDP-43 is a common pathological substrate underlying a large subset of these disorders, thereby implicating TDP-43 in novel and unifying mechanisms of FTLD pathogenesis.

Acta Neuropathol. 2007 Jul;114(1):63-70. Epub 2007 May 10. The rapid confirmation of the initial report by Neumann et al. (Science 314:130-133, 2006) that transactive response (TAR)-DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) is the major disease protein linking frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin-positive inclusions (FTLD-U) with and without motor neuron disease (MND) as well as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) implies that TDP-43 proteinopathy underlies major forms of sporadic as well as familial FTLD and ALS. Not only was the identity of the ubiquitinated proteins that accumulate in neurons and glia of these disorders finally resolved, but it also was shown that pathologic TDP-43 was hyperphosphorylated, ubiquitinated and cleaved to generate C-terminal fragments in affected brain and spinal cord of FTLD-U and ALS. This review summarizes the growing evidence that TDP-43 proteinopathy is the common pathologic substrate linking FTLD and ALS, and it considers the implications of these findings for developing better strategies to diagnose and treat these neurodegenerative disorders.

INTRODUCTION: Semantic dementia is a progressive, relatively selective disorder affecting the semantic system with involvement of the verbal and non-verbal functions. The clinical picture is well characterised despite the confusion that may be generated by the different ways of classifying it. AIM. To determine the clinical, neurolinguistic, imaging and pathological features of this progressive language disorder. DEVELOPMENT: Evaluation of language reveals above all the existence of semantic paraphasias, disorders affecting the comprehension of isolated words and surface dyslexia. Flow of speech, complex syntactic comprehension and grammar are preserved. Both episodic and autobiographic memory are close to normality. Both the clinical signs and symptoms and imaging studies agree on the fact that the most heavily affected area is the anteroinferomedial region of the temporal lobe on a bilateral scale but with predominance of the left-hand side. Pathologically, in most cases positive intraneuronal ubiquitin inclusions are observed like those described in motor neuron diseases. CONCLUSIONS: Semantic dementia constitutes a diagnosis challenge, mainly from the neuropsychological point of view. Further advances towards reaching a diagnosis would allow us to determine which area is mainly affected and, in the future, to find an effective treatment for this progressive, degenerative disorder.
motor_neuron_disease	ubiquitin	Negative	PMID:16317257	Katsuse O, Dickson DW: Ubiquitin immunohistochemistry of frontotemporal lobar degeneration differentiates cases with and without motor neuron disease. Behav Brain Res. 2005 Jul 30;162(2):233-9. Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) without tau pathology is clinically and pathologically heterogeneous. The present report describes the neuropathology of 52 brains with FTLD without tau pathology compared with 10 brains of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) without dementia using ubiquitin immunohistochemistry. The 52 cases were classified into 47 cases of FTLD with motor neuron disease (MND)-type inclusions but without MND (FTLD-MNI), three cases of FTLD with MND (FTLD-MND), and two cases of dementia lacking distinctive histopathology (DLDH) based on the features of ubiquitin-immunoreactive (ubiquitin-ir) structures in the caudate, frontotemporal cortices and dentate fascia, and presence or absence of neuronal loss in lower motor neurons. Many ubiquitin-ir neuronal inclusions and neurites in the caudate nucleus, frontotemporal cortices, and ubiquitin-ir crescent-or ring-shaped neuronal inclusions in the dentate fascia characterized FTLD-MNI. Ubiquitin-ir neuronal intranuclear inclusions (NII) were observed in 26 of 43 cases and associated with many neurites in the caudate nucleus as well as a familial history in most cases. A subset of cases had Pick-body-like inclusions in the dentate fascia and caudate nucleus with paucity of neuritic pathology and no NII; another had crescent-shaped inclusions in the dentate fascia and neuritic pathology with NII in the caudate. FTLD with MND was characterized by a few or no ubiquitin-ir inclusions in the caudate nucleus and frontotemporal cortices and ubiquitin-ir granular inclusions in the dentate fascia, as well as loss of lower motor neurons. These features were similar to ALS, but different from FTLD-MNI. The findings suggest that FTLD-MNI has a different pathogenesis from FTLD-MND and ALS.

Neurology. 2000 Feb 22;54(4):818-27. The frontotemporal dementias (FTDs) are a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative disorders that are characterized clinically by dementia, personality changes, language impairment, and occasionally extrapyramidal movement disorders. Historically, the diagnosis and classification of FTDs has been fraught with difficulties, especially with regard to establishing a consensus on the neuropathologic diagnosis. Recently, an international group of scientists participated in a consensus conference to develop such neuropathologic criteria. They recommended a diagnostic classification scheme that incorporated a biochemical analysis of the insoluble tau isoform composition, as well as ubiquitin immunohistochemistry. The use and reliability of this classification system has yet to be examined. In this study, we evaluated 21 cases of FTD. Using traditional histochemical stains and tau protein and ubiquitin immunohistochemistry, we separated each case into one of the following categories: classic Pick disease (PiD; n = 7), corticobasal degeneration (CBD; n = 5), dementia lacking distinctive histopathologic features (DLDH; n = 4), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP; n = 2), frontotemporal lobar degeneration with motor neuron disease or motor neuron disease-type inclusions (FTLD-MND/MNI; n = 2), and neurofibrillary tangle dementia (NFTD; n = 1). Additionally, we independently categorized each case by the insoluble tau isoform pattern, including 3R (n = 5), 4R (n = 7), 3R/4R (n = 3), and no insoluble tau (n = 6). As suggested by the proposed diagnostic scheme, we found that the insoluble tau isoform patterns correlated strongly with the independently derived histopathologic diagnoses (p CBD (71%) or PSP (29%). Cases with both 3R and 4R tau were either a combination of PiD and Alzheimer disease (67%) or NFTD (33%). Finally, cases with no insoluble tau were either DLDH (67%) or FTLD-MND/MNI (33%). To further characterize these cases, we also performed quantitative Western blots for soluble tau, APOE genotyping, and, in selected cases, tau gene sequencing. We show that soluble tau is reduced in DLDH and FTLD-MND/MNI and that APOE4 is overrepresented in PiD and DLDH. We also identified a new family with the R406W mutation and pathology consistent with NFTD. This study validates the recently proposed diagnostic criteria and forms a framework for further refinement of this classification scheme.

Neuropathology. 2004 Dec;24(4):306-14. Nine cases of atypical Pick's disease without Pick bodies (aPiD) and seven cases of dementia with motor neuron diseases (D-MND) were compared using immunohistochemistry of ubiquitin (ub) and ub-related proteins. All cases showed rostral-dominant atrophy in the temporal and frontal lobes, although the degree of atrophy with neuronal loss was much more severe in the aPiD cases. In both aPiD and D-MND cases, ub-positive and tau-negative structures were found mainly in the hippocampal dentate gyrus and cerebral cortex. Granular cells of the dentate gyrus showed similar ub-positive intraneuronal inclusions in both cases. In the aPiD cases, most of the ub-positive cortical structures were ub-positive dendrites in layers II-IIIab and layers V-VI, although some neurons also showed diffuse ub-positive staining in the cytoplasm. In the D-MND cases, some neurons showed ub-positive inclusions in layers II-IIIab, and ub-positive dendrites were unremarkable. The number of ub-positive neurons and dendrites in relation to the degree of neuronal loss in the cerebral cortex were then evaluated. The number of ub-positive neurons in the regions showing very mild to mild neuronal loss was significantly greater in the D-MND cases than in the aPiD cases. However, in the aPiD cases, the number of ub-positive neurons was significantly greater in the regions showing moderate neuronal loss. When double-immunostained, almost all ub-positive structures were positive for ub-binding protein p62. Some ub-positive or negative neurons in the cerebral cortex were immunostained with anti-ub ligase (Parkin) and anti-ub C-terminal hydrolase (UCH-L1) antibodies. Granular cells of the dentate gyrus were weakly positive for UCH-L1. There could be some differences in the mechanism by which neurons in the cerebral cortex accumulate ub between aPiD and D-MND.
motor_neuron_disease	ubiquitin	Negative	PMID:15641588	Yaguchi M, Fujita Y, Amari M, Takatama M, Al-Sarraj S, Leigh PN, Okamoto K: Morphological differences of intraneuronal ubiquitin-positive inclusions in the dentate gyrus and parahippocampal gyrus of motor neuron disease with dementia. Neuropathology. 2004 Dec;24(4):296-301. Semiquantitative morphological analysis of cerebral intraneuronal ubiquitin-positive tau-negative inclusions, a pathologic marker for motor neuron disease with dementia (MND-D), was performed in the dentate gyrus and parahippocampal gyrus of 20 clinicopathologically confirmed patients with MND-D. The forms of the inclusions were tentatively classified into three types: (i) C-type, consisting of relatively large and intensely stained crescent or circular structures; (ii) L-type, showing fine linear structures around the nuclei; and (iii) G-type, showing faintly stained granular structures. The frequencies of the C-type, L-type and G-type was 0.5-9.3%,0.2-6.5% and 0-6.6% of dentate granule cells, respectively. In contrast to the dentate gyrus, almost all inclusions showed either the C-type or L-type form in the parahippocampal gyrus. A positive correlation was noted only between incidences of C-type inclusion of the dentate gyrus and that of the parahippocampal gyrus (r = 0.69, P < 0.05). The morphological differences of the inclusions probably reflect different stages of their formation.
motor_neuron_disease	ubiquitin	Negative	PMID:15139588	Ikeda K, Tsuchiya K: Motor neuron disease group accompanied by inclusions of unidentified protein signaled by ubiquitin. Neuropathology. 2004 Jun;24(2):117-24. Peculiar tau-negative, ubiquitin-positive inclusions appear in dementia with ALS (ALS-D), the majority of lobar atrophy (Pick's disease) without Pick body and a small portion of ALS. Another common neuropathological lesion in these diseases is the motor neuron involvement with the degenerative processes. The lower motor neuron is predominantly involved in ALS and ALS-D the upper motor neuron is predominantly involved, but in varying degrees in a considerable number of patients with lobar atrophy that lack Pick bodies. There are, however, some points that have yet to be elucidated. The boundary between these diseases is not always clear and a significant number of cases are considered to be the transitional form. Lobar atrophy without Pick body seems to be a heterogeneous disease group. The nature of ubiquitin inclusions also needs to be clarified. Nevertheless, we postulate that these diseases are grouped with the concept of motor neuron disease-inclusion dementia.

J Neurol Sci. 2002 Mar 30;195(2):129-38. Little information is available on molecular defects involved in adult Sandhoff disease presenting as motor neuron disease phenotype. We studied enzyme activities of beta-hexosaminidase (Hex) and the HEXB gene encoding the beta-subunit of Hex in a family of the Japanese case. Enzyme assay with 4-methylumbelliferyl-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-beta-D-glucopyranoside revealed a reduction in Hex A and B activity in proband's leukocytes. Although the activity of both in the mother were intermediate between those of controls and the proband, only Hex B reduction determined with heat inactivation was found in the father. Analysis of HEXB gene demonstrated two novel point mutations. The first mutation, IVS2-1G> A, was located at the 3'-splice acceptor site of intron 2 derived from the mother, causing exon 3 skipping. The resultant mRNA encoded a shorter beta-chain, which may not form an active enzyme. The second mutation was a G-to-A transition in exon 13 (c.1598G> A) derived from the father and resulted in arginine-to-histidine substitution at amino acid position 533 (R533H). Expression of R533H mutation in COS-1 cells demonstrated a lack of normal Hex activity, indicating that this mutation is pathological. Compound heterozygosity of these two mutations may trigger the development of adult Sandhoff disease with a motor neuron disease phenotype.

Neurochem Res. 2004 Feb;29(2):403-6. R (-)-1-(benzo [b] thiophen-5-yl)-2-[2-(N,N-diethylamino) ethoxy] ethanol hydrochloride) (T-588) enhances acetylcholine release. This compound slows the motor deterioration of wobbler mouse motor neuron disease and enhances neurite outgrowth and choline acetyltransferase activity in cultured rat spinal motor neurons. We examined the ability of T-588 on axotomized spinal motor neuron death in the rat spinal cord. After the postnatal unilateral section of sciatic nerve, there was approximately a 50% survival of motor neurons in the fourth lumbar segment. In comparison with vehicle, intraperitoneal injection of T-588 for 14 consecutive days rescued spinal motor neuron death. Our results showing in vivo neurotrophic activity of T-588 for motor neurons support the applicability of T-588 for the treatment of motor neuron diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and motor neuropathies.

Neurology. 2005 May 10;64(9):1578-85. BACKGROUND: Frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism is often linked to chromosome 17 and is related to mutations in the MAPT gene. In some families the genetic basis is still unknown. The authors report two pedigrees with FTDP-17 harboring a novel mutation (K317M) in exon 11 in the MAPT gene. METHODS: The authors identified two apparently unrelated pedigrees with an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative condition. Thirteen patients were examined and eight autopsies were performed. RESULTS: Mean age at onset was 48 years. Mean disease duration was 6 years. Dysarthria often heralded the disease. All cases had parkinsonism and pyramidalism and half of them had amyotrophy. Behavioral or personality changes were not a prominent feature. Cognitive decline appeared late in the evolution. Neuropathologically, a massive degeneration of the substantia nigra without Lewy bodies was a constant finding. A variable degree of frontotemporal atrophy was found. Corticospinal tract degeneration and anterior horn neuron loss were present in six of seven autopsies in which the spinal cord was examined. An extensive deposition of abnormal tau protein in a mixed pattern (neuronal, glial) was observed. Pick's bodies were not seen. Biochemical analysis of tau revealed two bands of 64 and 68 kDa. CONCLUSION: Genetic analysis revealed the same novel mutation (K317M) in exon 11 of the MAPT gene in both pedigrees. A common haplotype between members of the two pedigrees suggests that they belong to the same family.
motor_neuron_disease	MAPT	Positive	PMID:14503643	Yancopoulou D, Crowther RA, Chakrabarti L, Gydesen S, Brown JM, Spillantini MG: Tau protein in frontotemporal dementia linked to chromosome 3 (FTD-3). J Neuropathol Exp Neurol. 2003 Aug;62(8):878-82. Recent work on frontotemporal dementia (FTD) has revealed the existence of at least 3 genetically distinct groups of inherited FTD: FTDP-17, FTD and motor neuron disease linked to chromosome 9, and FTD linked to chromosome 3 (FTD-3). Tau, on chromosome 17, is the only gene where mutations have been identified and its involvement in FTD has been firmly established. The genes on chromosome 9 and chromosome 3 associated with familial forms of FTD remain to be identified. Abnormal aggregates of tau protein characterize the brain lesions of FTDP-17 patients and ubiquitin inclusions have been found in FTD with motor neuron disease linked to chromosome 9. In this study the frontal cortices of 3 FTD-3 patients from a unique Danish family were examined for characteristic neuropathological features. In these brains tau inclusions were present in neurons and some glial cells in the absence of beta-amyloid deposits. The presence of filamentous tau protein in the frontal cortex of these patients suggests a possible link between tau and the genetic defect present on chromosome 3 and associated with FTD-3, although the limited amount of tau deposits observed makes it difficult to define this as a tauopathy.
motor_neuron_disease	MAPT	Positive	PMID:12481984	Tolnay M, Probst A: Frontotemporal lobar degeneration--tau as a pied piper? . Neurogenetics. 2002 Oct;4(2):63-75. Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is the second most-common form of cortical dementia in the presenium after Alzheimer disease. Clinically three disease entities can be distinguished: frontotemporal dementia, semantic dementia, and primary progressive aphasia. The underlying neuropathology can be classified into disorders with tau pathology (including Pick disease, corticobasal degeneration, progressive supranuclear palsy, and familial frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 - FTDP-17), and into disorders that lack tau abnormalities (including dementia lacking distinctive histology and motor neuron disease inclusion dementia). The recent discovery of tau gene mutations in FTDP-17 brought tau to the center stage, but led to the erroneous trend of collectively grouping all forms of FTLD as tauopathies. However, clinicopathological and genetic studies strongly suggest that the majority of sporadic and familial FTLD cases are not associated with tau pathology and/or tau gene mutations. Furthermore, recent studies have linked several autosomal dominantly inherited familial frontotemporal dementia cases to a variety of gene loci on different chromosomes. Thus, this review is intended to summarize our current knowledge about the sporadic and familial FTLD disorders that lack tau pathology, and shall further strengthen the view that FTLD is heterogeneous, both in terms of clinicopathological phenotypes as well as genetic backgrounds.
motor_neuron_disease	MAPT	Positive	PMID:11711205	Adamec E, Chang HT, Stopa EG, Hedreen JC, Vonsattel JP: Tau protein expression in frontotemporal dementias. Neurosci Lett. 2001 Nov 23;315(1-2):21-4. The syndrome of frontotemporal dementia represents a diverse group of diseases presenting with behavioral and cognitive disturbances. The expression of the microtubule-associated protein tau was studied in postmortem samples of frontal cortex of 19 cases (12 Pick's disease A, B, C; 4 dementia lacking distinct histology; 3 motor neuron disease type) by Western blotting with a phosphorylation-independent anti-tau antibody. The presence of tau protein was detected in all cases evaluated, including the 11 brains classified as frontotemporal lobe degeneration (diagnostic categories Pick's disease B, C and dementia lacking distinct histology). These findings indicate that the recently reported decreased expression of tau protein in frontotemporal lobe degeneration represents pathogenic mechanism of neurodegeneration detectable only in a special subset of these disorders.
motor_neuron_disease	Semaphorin-3A	Negative	PMID:16677822	De Winter F, Vo T, Stam FJ, Wisman LA, Bar PR, Niclou SP, van Muiswinkel FL, Verhaagen J: The expression of the chemorepellent Semaphorin 3A is selectively induced in terminal Schwann cells of a subset of neuromuscular synapses that display limited anatomical plasticity and enhanced vulnerability in motor neuron disease. Mol Cell Neurosci. 2006 May-Jun;32(1-2):102-17. Epub 2006 May 3. Neuromuscular synapses differ markedly in their plasticity. Motor nerve terminals innervating slow muscle fibers sprout vigorously following synaptic blockage, while those innervating fast-fatigable muscle fibers fail to exhibit any sprouting. Here, we show that the axon repellent Semaphorin 3A is differentially expressed in terminal Schwann cells (TSCs) on different populations of muscle fibers: postnatal, regenerative and paralysis induced remodeling of neuromuscular connections is accompanied by increased expression of Sema3A selectively in TSCs on fast-fatigable muscle fibers. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a molecular difference between TSCs on neuromuscular junctions of different subtypes of muscle fibers. Interestingly, also in a mouse model for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Sema3A is expressed at NMJs of fast-fatigable muscle fibers. We propose that expression of Sema3A by TSCs not only suppresses nerve terminal plasticity at specific neuromuscular synapses, but may also contribute to their early and selective loss in the motor neuron disease ALS.
motor_neuron_disease	Dynactin	Positive	PMID:17360970	Haghnia M, Cavalli V, Shah SB, Schimmelpfeng K, Brusch R, Yang G, Herrera C, Pilling A, Goldstein LS: Dynactin is required for coordinated bidirectional motility, but not for dynein membrane attachment. Mol Biol Cell. 2007 Jun;18(6):2081-9. Epub 2007 Mar 14. Transport of cellular and neuronal vesicles, organelles, and other particles along microtubules requires the molecular motor protein dynein (Mallik and Gross, 2004). Critical to dynein function is dynactin, a multiprotein complex commonly thought to be required for dynein attachment to membrane compartments (Karki and Holzbaur, 1999). Recent work also has found that mutations in dynactin can cause the human motor neuron disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Puls et al., 2003). Thus, it is essential to understand the in vivo function of dynactin. To test directly and rigorously the hypothesis that dynactin is required to attach dynein to membranes, we used both a Drosophila mutant and RNA interference to generate organisms and cells lacking the critical dynactin subunit, actin-related protein 1. Contrary to expectation, we found that apparently normal amounts of dynein associate with membrane compartments in the absence of a fully assembled dynactin complex. In addition, anterograde and retrograde organelle movement in dynactin deficient axons was completely disrupted, resulting in substantial changes in vesicle kinematic properties. Although effects on retrograde transport are predicted by the proposed function of dynactin as a regulator of dynein processivity, the additional effects we observed on anterograde transport also suggest potential roles for dynactin in mediating kinesin-driven transport and in coordinating the activity of opposing motors (King and Schroer, 2000).

Expert Rev Neurother. 2006 Mar;6(3):417-28. Although amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) was described more than 130 years ago, the cause (s) of most cases of this adult motor neuron disease remains a mystery. With the discovery of mutations in one gene (Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase) as a primary cause of some forms of ALS, model systems have been developed that have helped us begin to understand mechanisms involved in motor neuron death and enabled testing of potential new therapies. Several other genes have been implicated as risk factors in motor neuron diseases, including neurofilaments, cytoplasmic dynein and dynactin, vascular endothelial growth factor, and angiogenin. With advances in the basic research of the disease, many hypotheses accounting for motor neuron death are being explored, including loss of trophic support, protein mishandling, mitochondrial dysfunction, excitotoxicity, axonal abnormalities and inflammation. Many of these mechanisms are the focus of research in other neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and Huntington's disease.
motor_neuron_disease	Dynactin	Positive	PMID:16505168	Levy JR, Sumner CJ, Caviston JP, Tokito MK, Ranganathan S, Ligon LA, Wallace KE, LaMonte BH, Harmison GG, Puls I, Fischbeck KH, Holzbaur EL: A motor neuron disease-associated mutation in p150Glued perturbs dynactin function and induces protein aggregation. J Cell Biol. 2006 Feb 27;172(5):733-45. The microtubule motor cytoplasmic dynein and its activator dynactin drive vesicular transport and mitotic spindle organization. Dynactin is ubiquitously expressed in eukaryotes, but a G59S mutation in the p150Glued subunit of dynactin results in the specific degeneration of motor neurons. This mutation in the conserved cytoskeleton-associated protein, glycine-rich (CAP-Gly) domain lowers the affinity of p150Glued for microtubules and EB1. Cell lines from patients are morphologically normal but show delayed recovery after nocodazole treatment, consistent with a subtle disruption of dynein/dynactin function. The G59S mutation disrupts the folding of the CAP-Gly domain, resulting in aggregation of the p150Glued protein both in vitro and in vivo, which is accompanied by an increase in cell death in a motor neuron cell line. Overexpression of the chaperone Hsp70 inhibits aggregate formation and prevents cell death. These data support a model in which a point mutation in p150Glued causes both loss of dynein/dynactin function and gain of toxic function, which together lead to motor neuron cell death.

Ann Neurol. 2005 May;57(5):687-94. Impaired axonal transport has been postulated to play a role in the pathophysiology of multiple neurodegenerative disorders. In this report, we describe the results of clinical and neuropathological studies in a family with an inherited form of motor neuron disease caused by mutation in the p150Glued subunit of dynactin, a microtubule motor protein essential for retrograde axonal transport. Affected family members had a distinct clinical phenotype characterized by early bilateral vocal fold paralysis affecting the adductor and abductor laryngeal muscles. They later experienced weakness and atrophy in the face, hands, and distal legs. The extremity involvement was greater in the hands than in the legs, and it had a particular predilection for the thenar muscles. No clinical or electrophysiological sensory abnormality existed; however, skin biopsy results showed morphological abnormalities of epidermal nerve fibers. An autopsy study of one patient showed motor neuron degeneration and axonal loss in the ventral horn of the spinal cord and hypoglossal nucleus of the medulla. Immunohistochemistry showed abnormal inclusions of dynactin and dynein in motor neurons. This mutation of dynactin, a ubiquitously expressed protein, causes a unique pattern of motor neuron degeneration that is associated with the accumulation of dynein and dynactin in neuronal inclusions.

Although Charcot described amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) more than 130 years ago, the mechanism underlying the characteristic selective degeneration and death of motor neurons in this common adult motor neuron disease has remained a mystery. There is no effective remedy for this progressive, fatal disorder. Modern genetics has now identified mutations in one gene [Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1)] as a primary cause and implicated others [encoding neurofilaments, cytoplasmic dynein and its processivity factor dynactin, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)] as contributors to, or causes of, motor neuron diseases. These insights have enabled development of model systems to test hypotheses of disease mechanism and potential therapies. Along with errors in the handling of synaptic glutamate and the potential excitotoxic response this provokes, these model systems highlight the involvement of nonneuronal cells in disease progression and provide new therapeutic strategies.

Nat Genet. 2003 Apr;33(4):455-6. Epub 2003 Mar 10. Impaired axonal transport in motor neurons has been proposed as a mechanism for neuronal degeneration in motor neuron disease. Here we show linkage of a lower motor neuron disease to a region of 4 Mb at chromosome 2p13. Mutation analysis of a gene in this interval that encodes the largest subunit of the axonal transport protein dynactin showed a single base-pair change resulting in an amino-acid substitution that is predicted to distort the folding of dynactin's microtubule-binding domain. Binding assays show decreased binding of the mutant protein to microtubules. Our results show that dysfunction of dynactin-mediated transport can lead to human motor neuron disease.
motor_neuron_disease	glutaredoxin	Negative	PMID:17512091	Diwakar L, Kenchappa RS, Annepu J, Ravindranath V: Downregulation of glutaredoxin but not glutathione loss leads to mitochondrial dysfunction in female mice CNS: Implications in excitotoxicity. Neurochem Int. 2007 Jul;51(1):37-46. Epub 2007 Apr 5. Oxidative stress, excitotoxicity and mitochondrial dysfunction play synergistic roles in neurodegeneration. Maintenance of thiol homeostasis is important for normal mitochondrial function and dysregulation of protein thiol homeostasis by oxidative stress leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and neurodegeneration. We examined the critical roles played by the antioxidant, non-protein thiol, glutathione and related enzyme, glutaredoxin in maintaining mitochondrial function during excitotoxicity caused by beta-N-oxalyl amino-l-alanine (l-BOAA), the causative factor of neurolathyrism, a motor neuron disease involving the pyramidal system. l-BOAA causes loss of GSH and inhibition of mitochondrial complex I in lumbosacral cord of male mice through oxidation of thiol groups, while female mice are resistant. Reducing GSH levels in female mice CNS by pretreatment with diethyl maleate or l-propargyl glycine did not result in inhibition of complex I activity, unlike male mice. Further, treatment of female mice depleted of GSH with l-BOAA did not induce inhibition of complex I indicating that GSH levels were not critical for maintaining complex I activity in female mice unlike their male counterpart. Glutaredoxin, a thiol disulfide oxidoreductase helps maintain redox status of proteins and downregulation of glutaredoxin results in loss of mitochondrial complex I activity. Female mice express higher levels of glutaredoxin in certain CNS regions and downregulation of glutaredoxin using antisense oligonucleotides sensitizes them to l-BOAA toxicity seen as mitochondrial complex I loss. Ovariectomy downregulates glutaredoxin and renders female mice vulnerable to l-BOAA toxicity as evidenced by activation of AP1, loss of GSH and complex I activity indicating the important role of glutaredoxin in neuroprotection. Estrogen protects against mitochondrial dysfunction caused by excitotoxicity by maintaining cellular redox status through higher constitutive expression of glutaredoxin in the CNS. Therapeutic interventions designed to upregulate glutaredoxin may offer neuroprotection against excitotoxicity in motor neurons.

Exp Neurol. 2000 Jun;163(2):452-6. Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is the second most common cause of presenile dementia. Here we have investigated the frequency of the epsilon4 allele of the Apolipoprotein (APOE) gene in FTD and in other non-Alzheimer forms of dementia related to FTD such as Motor Neurone disease dementia, semantic dementia, progressive aphasia, progressive supranuclear palsy, and corticobasal degeneration. In none of these diagnostic groups did we find a significant increase in the APOE epsilon4 allelic frequency, compared to population values. Neither did we observe any affects of the epsilon4 allele upon age at onset or duration of disease. We conclude therefore that polymorphic variations in the APOE gene do not modulate either the occurrence or progression of these non-Alzheimer forms of dementia.
motor_neuron_disease	Gemin6	Positive	PMID:15843395	Feng W, Gubitz AK, Wan L, Battle DJ, Dostie J, Golembe TJ, Dreyfuss G: Gemins modulate the expression and activity of the SMN complex. Hum Mol Genet. 2005 Jun 15;14(12):1605-11. Epub 2005 Apr 20. Reduction in the expression of the survival of motor neurons (SMN) protein results in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a common motor neuron degenerative disease. SMN is part of a large macromolecular complex (the SMN complex) that includes at least six additional proteins called Gemins (Gemin2-7). The SMN complex is expressed in all cells and is present throughout the cytoplasm and in the nucleus where it is concentrated in Gems. The SMN complex plays an essential role in the production of spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) and likely other RNPs. To study the roles of the individual proteins, we systematically reduced the expression of SMN and each of the Gemins (2-6) by RNA interference. We show that the reduction of SMN leads to a decrease in snRNP assembly, the disappearance of Gems, and to a drastic reduction in the amounts of several Gemins. Moreover, reduction of Gemin2 or Gemin6 strongly decreases the activity of the SMN complex. These findings demonstrate that other components of the SMN complex, in addition to SMN, are critical for the activity of the complex and suggest that Gemin2 and Gemin6 are potentially important modifiers of SMA as well as potential disease genes for non-SMN motor neuron diseases.
motor_neuron_disease	phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase	Positive	PMID:11311806	Wagey R, Lurot S, Perrelet D, Pelech SL, Sagot Y, Krieger C: Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity in murine motoneuron disease: the progressive motor neuropathy mouse. Neuroscience. 2001;103(1):257-66. A murine model of motoneuron disease, the pmn/pmn mouse, shows a reduction in the retrograde transport of fluorescent probes applied directly onto the cut end of sciatic nerve. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), when co-applied with fluorescent tracers, increases the number of retrograde labelled motoneurons. We demonstrate here that spinal cord tissue from pmn/pmn mice had significantly reduced phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity and expression in the particulate fraction compared to controls, without changes in the activities or expression of the downstream kinases, protein kinase B/Akt or Erk1. Systemic administration of BDNF augmented phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase specific activity in spinal cord tissue from pmn/pmn and control mice, with a greater elevation in the particulate fractions of pmn/pmn mice than in controls. We examined the effect of inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase on the retrograde labelling of motoneurons, 24h following the direct application of inhibitors and Fluorogold to the cut end of sciatic nerve in control and pmn/pmn mice (labelling index). The mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitor PD 98059 had no effect on the labelling index in control or pmn/pmn mice. In the absence of exogenous BDNF, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors reduced the number of labelled motoneurons in control mice, without changing the labelling index in pmn/pmn. Co-application of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors with BDNF to the cut end of sciatic nerve blocked the action of BDNF on retrograde labelling in pmn/pmn mice. These results indicate that the retrograde labelling of motoneurons is mediated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent and -independent pathways. In pmn/pmn mice, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity in spinal neurons is below the level required for optimal retrograde labelling of motoneurons and labelling can be augmented by the administration of growth factors stimulating phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity. The data indicate that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity is important in the uptake and/or retrograde transport of substances by motoneurons and is altered in this model of motoneuron diseases.
motor_neuron_disease	DYNC1H1	Negative	PMID:16546759	Shah PR, Ahmad-Annuar A, Ahmadi KR, Russ C, Sapp PC, Horvitz HR, Brown RH Jr, Goldstein DB, Fisher EM: No association of DYNC1H1 with sporadic ALS in a case-control study of a northern European derived population: a tagging SNP approach. Amyotroph Lateral Scler. 2006 Mar;7(1):46-56. The cytoplasmic dynein-dynactin complex has been implicated in the aetiology of motor neuron degeneration in both mouse models and human forms of motor neuron disease. We have previously shown that mutations in the cytoplasmic dynein 1 heavy chain 1 gene (Dync1h1) are causal in a mouse model of late-onset motor neuron degeneration but have found no association of the homologous sites in human DYNC1H1 with human motor neuron disease. Here we extend these analyses to investigate the DYNC1H1 genomic locus to determine if it is associated with sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in a northern European-derived population. Among the 16 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) we examined, just two SNPs (rs2251644 and rs941793) were sufficient to tag the majority of haplotypic variation (r2 > or = 0.85) and these were tested in a case-control association study with 266 North American sporadic ALS patients and 225 matched controls. We found no association between genetic variation at DYNC1H1 and sporadic ALS (rs2251644; p = 0.538, rs941793; p = 0.204, haplotype; p = 0.956). In addition we investigated patterns of diversity at DYNC1H1 in Japanese and Cameroonian populations to establish the evolutionary history for this gene and observed reduced genetic diversity in the northern Europeans suggestive of selection at this locus.

Amyotroph Lateral Scler Other Motor Neuron Disord. 2003 Sep;4(3):150-7. We have shown in a mouse model of motor neuron disease, the legs-at-odd-angles (Loa) mutant, and that mutations in the cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain gene (Dnchc1) cause motor neuron degeneration. Mice exhibiting the Loa phenotype suffer progressive loss of locomotor function and homozygous animals have neuronal inclusion bodies that are positive for SOD1, CDK5, neurofilament and ubiquitin proteins. As this phenotype models some aspects of human motor neuron degeneration disorders, we think there is a reasonable likelihood that dynein may be a causative gene or susceptibility factor in human motor neuron disease. Therefore we have screened exons of this gene in a set of human patients with familial forms of disparate motor neuron degeneration diseases, affecting both upper and lower motor neurons: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), and hereditary spastic paraplegia. As part of this study, we have determined that DNCHC1 is a large gene of 78 exons spanning 86 kb genomic length. We have focused on the exons known to be mutated in Loa, and in a very similar mouse mutation, cramping 1 (Cra1); both mutations result in loss of anterior horn cells. The exons studied are highly conserved in a wide range of eukaryotes. We screened our patient samples by sequencing and although we detect single nucleotide polymorphisms, our results show these occur at the same frequency in our patient group as in control samples of unaffected individuals. Therefore we do not find any association between familial motor neuron disease and the genotypes presented here in the exons screened.

Amyotroph Lateral Scler Other Motor Neuron Disord. 2003 Sep;4(3):150-7. We have shown in a mouse model of motor neuron disease, the legs-at-odd-angles (Loa) mutant, and that mutations in the cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain gene (Dnchc1) cause motor neuron degeneration. Mice exhibiting the Loa phenotype suffer progressive loss of locomotor function and homozygous animals have neuronal inclusion bodies that are positive for SOD1, CDK5, neurofilament and ubiquitin proteins. As this phenotype models some aspects of human motor neuron degeneration disorders, we think there is a reasonable likelihood that dynein may be a causative gene or susceptibility factor in human motor neuron disease. Therefore we have screened exons of this gene in a set of human patients with familial forms of disparate motor neuron degeneration diseases, affecting both upper and lower motor neurons: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), and hereditary spastic paraplegia.

Acta Neuropathol. 2002 Oct;104(4):391-7. Epub 2002 Jun 26. Immunocytochemistry and microdensitometry applied under standardised conditions were used to evaluate neuronal nitric oxide synthase (NOS1) antigen in segmental motor neurones (MN) of six subjects without neurological disease, nine subjects with sporadic motor neurone disease (MND) and five with neurological disease unrelated to MND. No significant segmental differences in levels of NOS1 immunoreactivity occurred between the two control groups, and differences between cervical, thoracic and lumbar MN of the three subject groups were not significant. However, MND patients showed a significantly reduced level of NOS1 immunoreactivity in the Onuf's nucleus (ON); this is discussed in relation to neuroprotection and the relative sparing of ON in MND.
motor_neuron_disease	Bcl-2	Negative	PMID:12699624	Ferri A, Sanes JR, Coleman MP, Cunningham JM, Kato AC: Inhibiting axon degeneration and synapse loss attenuates apoptosis and disease progression in a mouse model of motoneuron disease. Curr Biol. 2003 Apr 15;13(8):669-73. Apoptosis is a hallmark of motoneuron diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) [1]. In a widely used mouse model of motoneuron disease (progressive motor neuronopathy or pmn) [2-4], transgenic expression of the anti-apoptotic bcl-2 gene [5] or treatment with glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor [6] prevents the apoptosis of the motoneuron soma; however, they were unable to affect the life span of the animals. The goal of the present work was to determine whether the pmn phenotype could be rescued by means of a gene that inhibits axon degeneration. For this reason, the pmn mice were crossed with mice bearing the dominant Wlds ("slow Wallerian degeneration") mutation, which slows axon degeneration and synapse loss [7-9]. We show here that the Wlds gene product attenuates symptoms, extends life span, prevents axon degeneration, rescues motoneuron number and size, and delays retrograde transport deficits in pmn/pmn mice. These results suggest new pathogenic mechanisms and therapeutic avenues for motoneuron diseases.

Gene Ther. 2001 Jul;8(13):977-86. We investigated genes expression by retrograde axonal transport of replication-defective adenoviruses carrying genes for LacZ (AdLacZ) and Bcl-2 in motor neurons of transgenic mice expressing mutant human Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) gene containing a substitution of alanine for glycine at position 93. We found that intramuscular injection of AdLacZ into the tongue of mutant SOD1 transgenic mice and their wild-type littermates at various ages results in high expression of the transgene and similar time course of expression in hypoglossal cranial nerve nuclei, suggesting no difference in the behavior of the transgene expression between the two groups. Subsequently, we employed a molecular switching cassette for Bcl-2 designed to express Bcl-2 by Cre-loxP recombination using adenoviral vectors, and examined the COS7 and primary neuronal cells with the mutant SOD1 gene. The overexpression of Bcl-2 in both cells and the neuronal protection against staurosporine-induced apoptosis were observed, after dual infection of adenoviral vectors with cassette for Bcl-2 (AxCALNLBcl-2) and Cre recombinase (AxCANCre). After inoculation of AxCALNLBcl-2 followed by AxCANCre into the tongue of both mutant SOD1 transgenic mice and wild-type littermates, Bcl-2 was detected in both the injection site and the hypoglossal nuclei of brainstems, suggesting that this was the result of retrograde transport of AxCALNLBcl-2 and AxCANCre and expression of Bcl-2 by Cre recombinase in the hypoglossal nuclei. This strategy for delivery of exogenous genes such as Bcl-2 will be useful for studying neuronal death/survival and introducing foreign genes into postmitotic motor neurons, and in gene therapy for motor neuron diseases such as ALS.
motor_neuron_disease	Survival-of-Motor-Neuron	Positive	PMID:16118268	Olaso R, Joshi V, Fernandez J, Roblot N, Courageot S, Bonnefont JP, Melki J: Activation of RNA metabolism-related genes in mouse but not human tissues deficient in SMN. Physiol Genomics. 2006 Jan 12;24(2):97-104. Epub 2005 Aug 23. Mutations of the survival of motor neuron gene (SMN1) are responsible for spinal muscular atrophies (SMA), a frequent recessive autosomal motor neuron disease. SMN is involved in various processes including RNA metabolism. However, the molecular pathway linking marked deficiency of SMN to SMA phenotype remains unclear. Homozygous deletion of murine Smn exon 7 directed to neurons or skeletal muscle causes severe motor axonal or myofiber degeneration, respectively. With the use of cDNA microarrays, expression profiles of 8,400 genes were analyzed in skeletal muscle and spinal cord of muscular and neuronal mutants, respectively, and compared with age-matched controls. A high proportion of genes (20 of 429, 5%) was involved in pre-mRNA splicing, ribosomal RNA processing, or RNA decay, and 18 of them were upregulated in mutant tissues. By analyzing other neuromuscular disorders, we showed that most of them (14 of 18) were specific to the SMN defect. Quantitative PCR analysis of these transcripts showed that gene activation was an early adaptive response to the lack but not reduced amount of full-length SMN in mouse mutant tissues. In human SMA tissues, activation of this program was not observed, which could be ascribed to the reduction but not the absence of full-length SMN.
motor_neuron_disease	Survival-of-Motor-Neuron	Positive	PMID:11135666	Selenko P, Sprangers R, Stier G, Buhler D, Fischer U, Sattler M: SMN tudor domain structure and its interaction with the Sm proteins. Nat Struct Biol. 2001 Jan;8(1):27-31. Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a common motor neuron disease that results from mutations in the Survival of Motor Neuron (SMN) gene. The SMN protein plays a crucial role in the assembly of spliceosomal uridine-rich small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (U snRNP) complexes via binding to the spliceosomal Sm core proteins. SMN contains a central Tudor domain that facilitates the SMN-Sm protein interaction. A SMA-causing point mutation (E134K) within the SMN Tudor domain prevents Sm binding. Here, we have determined the three-dimensional structure of the Tudor domain of human SMN. The structure exhibits a conserved negatively charged surface that is shown to interact with the C-terminal Arg and Gly-rich tails of Sm proteins. The E134K mutation does not disrupt the Tudor structure but affects the charge distribution within this binding site. An intriguing structural similarity between the Tudor domain and the Sm proteins suggests the presence of an additional binding interface that resembles that in hetero-oligomeric complexes of Sm proteins. Our data provide a structural basis for a molecular defect underlying SMA.
motor_neuron_disease	92-kDa-gelatinase	Positive	PMID:15729130	Dewil M, Schurmans C, Starckx S, Opdenakker G, Van Den Bosch L, Robberecht W: Role of matrix metalloproteinase-9 in a mouse model for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Neuroreport. 2005 Mar 15;16(4):321-4. The pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis remains poorly understood, but microglial and astroglial activation are thought to contribute to motor neuron death. Evidence suggests that matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) is a mediator of this deleterious effect. In this study, we evaluated the effect of MMP-9 on the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Although marked microglial and astroglial proliferation was seen in the spinal cord and in-vitro studies proved MMP-9 to be produced by these cells, deletion of the MMP-9 gene in SOD1 (G93A) mice accelerated rather than delayed the motor neuron disease and significantly reduced survival. Our results suggest that the effect of MMP-9 on mutant superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1)-induced motor neuron disease is protective rather than hazardous. Therefore, the effect of pharmacological inhibition of MMP-9 activity is unlikely to be of therapeutical benefit in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

Dev Neurobiol. 2007 Feb 15;67(3):270-84. Precursor cells of the human central nervous system can be cultured in vitro to reveal pathogenesis of diseases or developmental disorders. Here, we have studied the biology of neural precursor cells (NPCs) from patients of lethal congenital contracture syndrome (LCCS), a severe motoneuron disease leading to prenatal death before the 32nd gestational week. LCCS fetuses are immobile because of a motoneuron defect, seen as degeneration of the anterior horn and descending tracts of the developing spinal cord. The genetic defect for the syndrome is unknown. We show that NPCs isolated postmortem from LCCS fetuses grow and are maintained in culture, but display increased cell cycle activity. Global transcript analysis of undifferentiated LCCS precursor cells present with changes in EGF-related signaling when compared with healthy age-matched human controls. Further, we show that LCCS-derived NPCs differentiate into cells of neuronal and glial lineage and that the initial differentiation is not accompanied by overt apoptosis. Cells expressing markers Islet-1 and Hb9 are also generated from the LCCS NPCs, suggesting that the pathogenic mechanism of LCCS does not directly affect the differentiation capacity or survival of the cells, but the absence of motoneurons in LCCS may be caused by a noncell autonomous mechanism.
motor_neuron_disease	poliovirus-receptor	Positive	PMID:15076773	Saunderson R, Yu B, Trent RJ, Pamphlett R: A polymorphism in the poliovirus receptor gene differs in motor neuron disease. Neuroreport. 2004 Feb 9;15(2):383-6. Poliovirus has been implicated in the etiology of sporadic motor neuron disease. DNA polymorphisms in the poliovirus receptor gene (PVR) are associated with persistent poliovirus infection in cell culture. PVR DNA polymorphisms were therefore studied in 110 cases of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, 30 cases of progressive muscular atrophy (a disorder of lower motor neurons) and 280 normal controls. In exon 2 of PVR the heterozygous Ala67Thr change was detected in 20.0% of progressive muscular atrophy, 11.8% of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and 6.8% of control subjects. The frequency of the polymorphism was significantly higher in patients with progressive muscular atrophy than in controls. Differences in the poliovirus receptor gene may result in slowly progressive viral cytopathic effects that lead to lower motor neuron forms of motor neuron disease.
motor_neuron_disease	Hsp70	Negative	PMID:16184763	Batulan Z, Nalbantoglu J, Durham HD: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs differentially affect the heat shock response in cultured spinal cord cells. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2005 Autumn;10(3):185-96. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been shown to amplify the heat shock response in cell lines by increasing the binding of heat shock transcription factor-1 to heat shock elements within heat shock gene promoters. Because overexpression of the inducible heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) was neuroprotective in a culture model of motor neuron disease, this study investigated whether NSAIDs induce Hsp70 and confer cytoprotection in motor neurons of dissociated spinal cord cultures exposed to various stresses. Two NSAIDs, sodium salicylate and niflumic acid, lowered the temperature threshold for induction of Hsp70 in glia but failed to do so in motor neurons. At concentrations that increased Hsp70 in heat shocked glial cells, sodium salicylate failed to delay death of motor neurons exposed to hyperthermia, paraquat-mediated oxidative stress, and glutamate excitotoxicity. Neither sodium salicylate nor the cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, niflumic acid, protected motor neurons from the toxicity of mutated Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD-1) linked to a familial form of the motor neuron disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Thus, treatment with 2 types of NSAIDs failed to overcome the high threshold for the activation of heat shock response in motor neurons.

Genetika. 2004 Jun;40(6):850-2. Ile105Val polymorphism in exon 5 of glutathione S-transferase (GSTP1) gene was examined in a group of patients with motor neuron disease (MND) and control sample. No statistically significant differences in the allele and genotype frequency distributions between the samples examined were demonstrated. We conclude that Ile105Val polymorphism is not associated with the risk of the disease development in the patients from Russia with sporadic form of MND.

Genetika. 2002 Nov;38(11):1566-8. Comparison of the frequency distributions of alleles, genotypes, and genotype combinations of genes GSTM1 and GSTT1 did not show statistically significant differences between patients with motor neuron disease (MND) and a random sample from the Moscow population. Apparently, these genes are not involved in MND pathogenesis in these patients.

Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2007 Mar 9;354(2):491-7. Epub 2007 Jan 11. ALS2, the causative gene product for a number of recessive motor neuron diseases, is a guanine-nucleotide exchange factor for Rab5, and acts as a modulator for endosome dynamics. Recently, we have identified a novel ALS2 homolog, ALS2CL, which is highly homologous to the C-terminal half of ALS2. In this study, we investigate the molecular features of ALS2CL and its functional relationship with ALS2. A majority of ALS2CL is present as a homo-dimeric form, which can interact with the ALS2-oligomer, resulting in the formation of the large ALS2/ALS2CL heteromeric complex. In cultured cells, overexpressed ALS2CL is colocalized with ALS2 onto membranous compartments. Further, ALS2CL dominantly suppresses the endosome enlargement induced by a constitutively active form of ALS2, and results in an extensive perinuclear tubulo-membranous phenotype, which are dependent upon the ALS2CL-ALS2 interaction. Collectively, ALS2CL is a novel ALS2-interacting protein and is implicated in ALS2-mediated endosome dynamics.

Arch Neurol. 2005 Oct;62(10):1591-4. BACKGROUND: In neurodegenerative diseases, increasing attention has been focused on inflammatory mediators such as pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines and their potential influence in the process of neurodegeneration. In prion diseases, much data has been gained on the cell culture and animal disease models level, but only limited information is available on humans affected by Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). OBJECTIVE: To obtain data on anti-inflammatory cytokines interleukin 4 and interleukin 10 in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with CJD, patients with other dementia, and nondemented neurological patients and controls. DESIGN: Cerebrospinal fluid samples were collected from CJD patients and control subjects, and concentrations of the anti-inflammatory cytokines interleukin 4 and interleukin 10 were determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

The group was composed of patients with CJD (n = 20), patients with other forms of dementia (n = 10), patients with motoneuron disease (n = 6), patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus (n = 5), and control subjects (n = 20). RESULTS: Interleukin 10 levels were significantly elevated in the cerebrospinal fluid of CJD patients (median, 9.8 pg/mL).

The data of the present study provide a clue toward the possible role of cytokines as immunological modifiers in the neurodegenerative process of CJD.

Neurobiol Dis. 2006 Jul;23(1):97-108. Epub 2006 Apr 27. A severe recessive cerebellar ataxia, Ataxia-Oculomotor Apraxia 2 (AOA2) and a juvenile onset form of dominant amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS4) result from mutations of the Senataxin (SETX) gene. To begin characterization this disease protein, we developed a specific antibody to the DNA/RNA helicase domain of SETX. In murine brain, SETX concentrates in several regions, including cerebellum, hippocampus and olfactory bulb with a general neuronal expression profile, colocalizing with NeuN. In cultured cells, we found that SETX was cytoplasmically diffuse, but in the nucleus, SETX was punctate, colocalizing with fibrillarin, a marker of the nucleolus. In differentiated non-cycling cells, nuclear SETX was not restricted to the nucleolus but was diffuse within the nucleoplasm, suggesting cell-cycle-dependent localization. SETX missense mutations cluster within the N-terminus and helicase domains. Flag tagging at the N-terminus caused protein mislocation to the nucleoplasm and failure to export to the cytoplasm, suggesting that the N-terminus may be essential for correct SETX localization. We report here the first characterization of SETX protein, which may provide future insights into a new mechanism leading to neuron death.

Acta Neuropathol. 2004 May;107(5):399-405. Epub 2004 Feb 25. The pathophysiological basis of cognitive dysfunction, including frontotemporal dementia (FTD), in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and ALS with dementia (ALSD) remains unclear. On the other hand, increased expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in the spinal cord is thought to play a pivotal role in motor neuron degeneration in ALS. In this study, to assess the relationship between the neuronal COX-2 expression in the cerebrum, the formation of tau- and alpha-synuclein-negative but ubiquitin-positive neuronal inclusions (UPIs), and dementia in motor neuron disease (MND), we examined neuronal COX-2 immunoreactivity in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of patients with non-demented ALS without UPIs ( n=11), ALSD with UPIs ( n=6), and normal controls ( n=24) using a quantitative immunohistochemical technique. Neuronal COX-2 expression in all CA1-4 in the hippocampus was significantly up-regulated in the ALSD group, and, to lesser degree but significantly, in the ALS group. Neuronal COX-2 expression in the frontal cortex was also significantly up-regulated in the ALSD group but not in the ALS group. These findings suggest that (1) the frontal cortex and hippocampus of MND are involved in the same pathogenic process associated with COX-2 induction that has been observed in spinal anterior horn cells, (2) COX-2 induction in the cerebrum is a pathogenic process that can occur even in the absence of UPI formation in MND, and (3) COX-2 expression in the cerebrum may be associated with cognitive dysfunction in MND.
motor_neuron_disease	SCA1	Negative	PMID:12651867	Okuda T, Hattori H, Takeuchi S, Shimizu J, Ueda H, Palvimo JJ, Kanazawa I, Kawano H, Nakagawa M, Okazawa H: PQBP-1 transgenic mice show a late-onset motor neuron disease-like phenotype. Hum Mol Genet. 2003 Apr 1;12(7):711-25. A body of experimental evidence indicates that transcription and/or mRNA processing factors interacting with the polyglutamine disease gene products play crucial roles in the pathology. PQBP-1 is one of these factors and it has been shown to interact with the spinocerebellar ataxia type-1 (SCA1) disease gene product, ataxin-1. Our previous data suggested that relatively high expression of PQBP-1 in the cerebellum might explain the selective neuronal degeneration of SCA1. To further test whether PQBP-1 expression level regulates neuronal death, we generated transgenic mice of human PQBP-1 driven by a regulatory element for ubiquitous gene expression. The mice showed a late-onset and gradually progressive motor neuron disease-like phenotype, which might be related to neurogenic muscular atrophy observed in SCA1 patients. Ataxia could not be discriminated from predominant progressive weakness. Pathological examinations of the transgenic mice revealed loss of Purkinje and granular cells in the cerebellum as well as that of spinal motor neurons, corresponding to the pathology of human SCA1. These findings show that excessive action of PQBP-1 causes neuronal dysfunction and support PQBP-1 being involved in the pathology of SCA1.

Rinsho Shinkeigaku. 2007 Jan;47(1):37-41. Here, we report a Japanese man with adult Sandhoff disease who presented with a motor neuron disease phenotype with slow progression. At the age of 42, he noticed weakness in his legs. At the age of 46, he was admitted to our hospital. Neurological examination revealed muscle weakness and atrophy of the upper and lower extremities, and hyperreflexia of the upper extremities. Magnetic resonance imaging showed very mild cerebellar atrophy. We diagnosed him as having atypical amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Because of the atypical course of motor neuron disease, hexosaminidase activity in peripheral leukocytes was indicated. Asseys of hexosaminidase A and hexosaminidase B showed low activities, and we found a membranous cytoplasmic body in the submucosal nerve, leading to the diagnosis of Sandhoff disease. This is the second case of a Japanese adult with Sandhoff disease presenting with a motor neuron disease phenotype, and to our knowledge, this is the latest age of onset in Japan.

Rinsho Shinkeigaku. 2001 Jan;41(1):36-9. A 35-year old Japanese male with adult Sandhoff disease was described, who was presented as a motor neuron disease phenotype with slow progression. At the age of 15, he first noticed weakness in his thigh. At the age of 28, his upper and lower motor neuron disturbances were disclosed. He was diagnosed as atypical amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. At the age of 34, a slight sensory disturbance appeared in the lower extremities. When he was admitted to our hospital, he displayed marked atrophy and weakness in his quadriceps femoris muscles, but no signs of mental deterioration and cerebellar ataxia. Because of the atypical course of motor neuron disease, hexosaminidase activity in peripheral leukocytes was determined. The assay of total hexosaminidase, hexosaminidase A and hexosaminidase B activities demonstrated low levels of these activities (7-15% of controls), leading the diagnosis of Sandoff disease. He was a member of non-consanguineous family, and the abnormal patterns of hexasaminidase activities were different between his father and mother. These data appear to show that he is a compound heterozygote in the locus of the hexosaminidase B gene. This is the first Japanese case of adult Sanhoff disease presented as a motor neuron disease phenotype.
motor_neuron_disease	peripherin	Positive	PMID:15773754	Julien JP, Millecamps S, Kriz J: Cytoskeletal defects in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (motor neuron disease). Novartis Found Symp. 2005;264:183-92; discussion 192-6 There is growing evidence for the involvement of cytoskeletal defects in the pathogenesis of motor neuron disease and especially in components of the microtubule-based transport system. Here we will review our recent work aiming to elucidate the role of peripherin in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and to address the mechanism of disease caused by deletions in the ALS2 gene that cause recessive forms of juvenile ALS and primary lateral sclerosis (PLS). Peripherin is an intermediate filament protein detected in spheroids, a hallmark of ALS, and increased levels of peripherin mRNA have been found in some ALS cases. Our transgenic mouse and cell culture studies support the view of a peripherin involvement in ALS. However, a gene knockout approach demonstrated that peripherin is not a key contributor of motor neuron disease caused by mutant superoxide dismutase linked to familial ALS. A recent breakthrough in the field of ALS came with the discovery of frameshift deletions in the ALS2 gene coding for Alsin. Our transfection experiments in cultured cells suggest that Alsin is a cytoskeletal protein with dual endosomal and centrosomal localizations. We have generated a mouse knockout for Alsin that develops progressive motor dysfunction during ageing. Thus, it is anticipated that this mouse model will be useful to investigate the pathogenic pathways linked to Alsin gene mutations.
motor_neuron_disease	peripherin	Positive	PMID:15446584	Leung CL, He CZ, Kaufmann P, Chin SS, Naini A, Liem RK, Mitsumoto H, Hays AP: A pathogenic peripherin gene mutation in a patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Biochimie. 2002 Nov;84(11):1151-60. Peripherin is a neuronal intermediate filament protein that is expressed chiefly in motor neurons and other nerve cells that project into the peripheral nervous system. Transgenic mice that over-express peripherin develop motor neuron degeneration, suggesting that mutations in peripherin could contribute to the development of motor neuron disease. In this paper, we report the identification of a homozygous mutation in the peripherin gene (PRPH) in a patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The mutation resulted in a substitution of aspartate with tyrosine at amino acid position 141, which is located within the first linker region of the rod domain. Immunocytochemical analysis of the spinal cord of the patient upon autopsy revealed distinctive large aggregates within the cell bodies of residual spinal motor neurons that contained peripherin and was also immunoreactive with antibodies to the neurofilament proteins. In order to study the effect of the mutation on peripherin assembly, we performed transient transfections. Unlike wild-type peripherin, which self-assembles to form a filamentous network, the mutant peripherin was prone to form aggregates in transfected cells, indicating that the mutation adversely affects peripherin assembly. Moreover, the neurofilament light (NF-L) protein was not able to rescue the mutant protein from forming aggregates. These data imply that mutation of PRPH is a contributing factor for ALS.
motor_neuron_disease	peripherin	Positive	PMID:15132161	Beaulieu JM, Nguyen MD, Julien JP: Late onset of motor neurons in mice overexpressing wild-type peripherin. . J Neurosci. 2000 Jul 15;20(14):5321-8. Peripherin, a type III intermediate filament (IF) protein, upregulated by injury and inflammatory cytokines, is a component of IF inclusion bodies associated with degenerating motor neurons in sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We report here that sustained overexpression of wild-type peripherin in mice provokes massive and selective degeneration of motor axons during aging. Remarkably, the onset of peripherin-mediated disease was precipitated by a deficiency of neurofilament light (NF-L) protein, a phenomenon associated with sporadic ALS. In NF-L null mice, the overexpression of peripherin led to early- onset formation of IF inclusions and to the selective death of spinal motor neurons at 6 mo of age. We also report the formation of similar peripherin inclusions in presymptomatic transgenic mice expressing a mutant form of superoxide dismutase linked to ALS. Taken together, these results suggest that IF inclusions containing peripherin may play a contributory role in motor neuron disease.
motor_neuron_disease	peripherin	Positive	PMID:12828939	Lariviere RC, Beaulieu JM, Nguyen MD, Julien JP: Peripherin is not a contributing factor to motor neuron disease in a mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis caused by mutant superoxide dismutase.  227-30. Peripherin is a type III intermediate filament protein detected in axonal spheroids associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The overexpression of peripherin induces degeneration of spinal motor neurons during aging in transgenic mice and in cultured neuronal cells derived from peripherin transgenic embryos. Here, we investigated whether peripherin is a contributor of pathogenesis in mice overexpressing a mutant superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1 (G37R)) gene linked to familial ALS. This was done by the generation and analysis of SOD1 (G37R) mice that either overexpress a peripherin transgene (G37R;TgPer mice) or lack the endogenous peripherin gene (G37R;Per-/- mice). Surprisingly, upregulation or suppression of peripherin expression had no effects on disease onset, mortality, and loss of motor neurons in SOD1 (G37R) mice. These results provide compelling evidence that peripherin is not a key contributor of motor neuron degeneration associated with toxicity of mutant SOD1.
motor_neuron_disease	Rab5	Negative	PMID:17239822	Suzuki-Utsunomiya K, Hadano S, Otomo A, Kunita R, Mizumura H, Osuga H, Ikeda JE: ALS2CL, a novel ALS2-interactor, modulates ALS2-mediated endosome dynamics. Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2007 Mar 9;354(2):491-7. Epub 2007 Jan 11. ALS2, the causative gene product for a number of recessive motor neuron diseases, is a guanine-nucleotide exchange factor for Rab5, and acts as a modulator for endosome dynamics. Recently, we have identified a novel ALS2 homolog, ALS2CL, which is highly homologous to the C-terminal half of ALS2. In this study, we investigate the molecular features of ALS2CL and its functional relationship with ALS2. A majority of ALS2CL is present as a homo-dimeric form, which can interact with the ALS2-oligomer, resulting in the formation of the large ALS2/ALS2CL heteromeric complex. In cultured cells, overexpressed ALS2CL is colocalized with ALS2 onto membranous compartments. Further, ALS2CL dominantly suppresses the endosome enlargement induced by a constitutively active form of ALS2, and results in an extensive perinuclear tubulo-membranous phenotype, which are dependent upon the ALS2CL-ALS2 interaction. Collectively, ALS2CL is a novel ALS2-interacting protein and is implicated in ALS2-mediated endosome dynamics.

Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2006 Jun 20;103(25):9595-600. Epub 2006 Jun 12. ALS2 is an autosomal recessive form of spastic paraparesis (motor neuron disease) with juvenile onset and slow progression caused by loss of function of alsin, an activator of Rac1 and Rab5 small GTPases. To establish an animal model of ALS2 and derive insights into the pathogenesis of this illness, we have generated alsin-null mice. Cytosol from brains of Als2 (-/-) mice shows marked diminution of Rab5-dependent endosome fusion activity. Furthermore, primary neurons from Als2 (-/-) mice show a disturbance in endosomal transport of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) and BDNF receptors, whereas neuronal viability and endocytosis of transferrin and dextran seem unaltered. There is a significant decrease in the size of cortical motor neurons, and Als2 (-/-) mice are mildly hypoactive. Altered trophic receptor trafficking in neurons of Als2 (-/-) mice may underlie the histopathological and behavioral changes observed and the pathogenesis of ALS2.
motor_neuron_disease	Rab5	Negative	PMID:12837691	Otomo A, Hadano S, Okada T, Mizumura H, Kunita R, Nishijima H, Showguchi-Miyata J, Yanagisawa Y, Kohiki E, Suga E, Yasuda M, Osuga H, Nishimoto T, Narumiya S, Ikeda JE: ALS2, a novel guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the small GTPase Rab5, is implicated in endosomal dynamics. Hum Mol Genet. 2003 Jul 15;12(14):1671-87. ALS2 mutations account for a number of recessive motor neuron diseases including forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, primary lateral sclerosis and hereditary spastic paraplegia. Although computational predictions suggest that ALS2 encodes a protein containing multiple guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) domains [RCC1-like domain (RLD), the Dbl homology and pleckstrin homology (DH/PH), and the vacuolar protein sorting 9 (VPS9)], the functions of the ALS2 protein have not been revealed as yet. Here we show that the ALS2 protein specifically binds to small GTPase Rab5 and functions as a GEF for Rab5. Ectopically expressed ALS2 protein localizes with Rab5 and early endosome antigen-1 (EEA1) onto early endosomal compartments and stimulates the enlargement of endosomes in cultured cortical neurons. The carboxy-terminus of ALS2 protein carrying a VPS9 domain mediates not only the activation of Rab5 via a guanine-nucleotide exchanging reaction but also the endosomal localization of the ALS2 protein, while the amino-terminal half containing RLD acts suppressive in its membranous localization. Further, the DH/PH domain in the middle portion of ALS2 protein enhances the VPS9 domain-mediated endosome fusions. Taken together, the ALS2 protein as a novel Rab5-GEF, ALS2rab5GEF seems to be implicated in the endosomal dynamics in vivo. Notably, a feature common to eight reported ALS2 mutations among motor neuron diseases is the loss of VPS9 domain, resulting in the failure of Rab5 activation. Thus, a perturbation of endosomal dynamics caused by loss of ALS2 rab5GEF activity might underlie neuronal dysfunction and degeneration in a number of motor neuron diseases.
motor_neuron_disease	MT-II	Positive	PMID:16179515	Ignacio S, Moore DH, Smith AP, Lee NM: Effect of neuroprotective drugs on gene expression in G93A/SOD1 mice. Ann N Y Acad Sci. 2005 Aug;1053:121-36. Gene expression analysis is a powerful tool that has been used to define the pathological processes underlying many diseases. Several laboratories, including our own, have used this approach to identify molecular abnormalities in the G93A/SOD1 mouse, an animal model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Here, we report the results of analysis of an expanded panel of genes throughout the entire lifetime in the spinal cord of these animals. In addition to upregulation of microglia/neuroinflammatory genes identified previously, we observed upregulation of metallothionein-I and -II (MT-I, MT-II). MT-I and MT-II play an important role in disposition of zinc ion, and other studies have also indicated their levels are altered in development of motor neuron disease in these animals. We also analyzed the effect on these expression profiles of several candidate drugs that have been shown to have neuroprotective effects in vivo or in vitro. That is, we asked whether administration to the G93A/SOD1 mice of any of these drugs could reverse the alterations in gene expression patterns that occur as the animals develop. The mice were given daily doses of these drugs when they were 9-11 weeks old, at a stage early in development of motor neuron disease, continuing for 5 weeks, at which time they were sacrificed. Treatment of the mice with l-carnosine, a dipeptide that scavenges free radicals and chelates zinc, did not affect expression of any of the genes altered in these animals. However, it did upregulate 3 genes unaffected by the presence of the G93A/SOD1 mutation: glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), stroma-derived factor-1 (SDF-1), and excitatory amino acid transporter-2 (EAAT2). In contrast, metallothionein-III (MT-III) was downregulated. Treatment of the animals with baicalein, an herbal extract with anti-inflammatory and numerous other effects, downregulated the microglia markers CD68, CD80, and CD86, all of which were upregulated in untreated mutant animals. Baicalein treatment also downregulated tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFRp55) and upregulated noninducible nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and glutamine synthase (GS). These 3 genes were unaffected by the presence of the G93A mutation. We discuss the implication of these results for testing the effects of these and other candidate drugs in mutant SOD1 mice.

Genetika. 2006 Jan;42(1):104-9. Polymorphisms of the genes of the glutamatergic system EAAT2, GRIA1, and GRIA2 have been analyzed in patients with sporadic motor neuron disease (MND) from Russia. The disease is not associated with polymorphic alleles of the genes studied, which indicates that EAAT2, GRIA1, and GRIA2 play an insignificant role in the pathogenesis of sporadic MND.
motor_neuron_disease	GDNFR-alpha	Positive	PMID:10447463	Yamamoto M, Mitsuma N, Inukai A, Ito Y, Li M, Mitsuma T, Sobue G: Expression of GDNF and GDNFR-alpha mRNAs in muscles of patients with motor neuron diseases. Neurochem Res. 1999 Jun;24(6):785-90. The mRNA expression levels of GDNF, GDNFR-alpha and RET were examined in the muscles of amyotrophic lateral screlosis (ALS) and X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA). GDNF mRNA levels were significantly elevated to variable extent in the diseased muscles compared to control muscles, although they were not specific to the type of the diseases. The diseased muscles also have a different expression pattern of GDNF mRNA isoforms from controls. GDNF mRNA expression, however, tended to reduce in advanced muscle pathology. On the other hand, GDNFR-alpha mRNA levels were not changed significantly on expression levels in the diseased muscles. In situ hybridization study revealed that GDNF and GDNFR-alpha mRNAs were localized in subsarcolemmal space of muscle cells. RET mRNA was not detected in control nor diseased muscles. These results suggest that the elevated muscle GDNF acts as a trophic signal for motor neurons of motor neuron diseases, implying a possible therapeutic implication of GDNF to this type of diseases.
motor_neuron_disease	VEGF	Positive	PMID:17130418	Cronin S, Greenway MJ, Ennis S, Kieran D, Green A, Prehn JH, Hardiman O: Elevated serum angiogenin levels in ALS. Neurology. 2006 Nov 28;67(10):1833-6. BACKGROUND: The role of hypoxia responsive genes in the pathogenesis of ALS was first suggested when deletions of the hypoxia-responsive element of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) promoter caused a motor neuron disease phenotype in mice. The discovery of ALS-associated mutations in ANG, a hypoxia responsive gene coding for the protein angiogenin, has further supported this pathogenic mechanism in human ALS. In endothelium, angiogenin can regulate expression of VEGF. To date, the patterns of serum angiogenin expression among patients with ALS have not been assessed. METHODS: Serum angiogenin and VEGF levels were quantified at diagnosis in 79 patients with definite or probable ALS and 72 healthy controls, using a quantitative sandwich enzyme-linked immunoassay. RESULTS: Patients with ALS exhibited higher serum angiogenin (p = 0.006) but not VEGF (p = 0.55) levels than matched control subjects. Subgroup analysis showed a greater elevation in angiogenin levels for spinal- (p angiogenin levels remained elevated. No correlation was noted between angiogenin and VEGF levels (r = -0.08, p = 0.49) in ALS patient serum. CONCLUSION: These data suggest a modest elevation in serum angiogenin in ALS at diagnosis. Further investigation will be required to assess the utility of serum angiogenin as a biomarker for ALS and as a predictor of disease progression.

Expert Rev Neurother. 2006 Mar;6(3):417-28. Although amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) was described more than 130 years ago, the cause (s) of most cases of this adult motor neuron disease remains a mystery. With the discovery of mutations in one gene (Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase) as a primary cause of some forms of ALS, model systems have been developed that have helped us begin to understand mechanisms involved in motor neuron death and enabled testing of potential new therapies. Several other genes have been implicated as risk factors in motor neuron diseases, including neurofilaments, cytoplasmic dynein and dynactin, vascular endothelial growth factor, and angiogenin. With advances in the basic research of the disease, many hypotheses accounting for motor neuron death are being explored, including loss of trophic support, protein mishandling, mitochondrial dysfunction, excitotoxicity, axonal abnormalities and inflammation. Many of these mechanisms are the focus of research in other neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and Huntington's disease.
motor_neuron_disease	VEGF	Positive	PMID:16355213	Greenberg DA, Jin K: From angiogenesis to neuropathology. Nature. 2005 Dec 15;438(7070):954-9. Angiogenesis--the growth of new blood vessels--is a crucial force for shaping the nervous system and protecting it from disease. Recent advances have improved our understanding of how the brain and other tissues grow new blood vessels under normal and pathological conditions. Angiogenesis factors, especially vascular endothelial growth factor, are now known to have roles in the birth of new neurons (neurogenesis), the prevention or mitigation of neuronal injury (neuroprotection), and the pathogenesis of stroke, Alzheimer's disease and motor neuron disease. As our understanding of pathophysiology grows, these developments may point the way towards new molecular and cell-based therapies.

Neurobiol Dis. 2004 Oct;17(1):21-8. Both in mice and humans, low expression levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) are linked to adult-onset motor neuron disease or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The mechanism through which reduced VEGF levels result in this phenotype is unknown. We therefore examined the direct effects of VEGF on motor neurons and found VEGF to have a direct neurotrophic effect on motor neurons in vitro. Survival and vulnerability to excitotoxicity of motor neurons from VEGF (delta/delta) mice was however similar to that of motor neurons from non-transgenic littermates. The VEGF concentration in the spinal cord of mutant (G93A) SOD1 mice was not different from that found in wild-type SOD1 overexpressing mice. Upregulation of VEGF in the spinal cord, by housing mutant (G93A) SOD1 mice in hypoxic conditions, did not affect their life span. Our results show that VEGF is a neurotrophic factor for motor neurons in vitro, and shortage of this neurotrophic factor may contribute to the motor neuron death observed in humans and animals with low VEGF expression levels.
motor_neuron_disease	VEGF	Positive	PMID:15217349	Bruijn LI, Miller TM, Cleveland DW: Unraveling the mechanisms involved in motor neuron degeneration in ALS. Annu Rev Neurosci. 2004;27:723-49. Although Charcot described amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) more than 130 years ago, the mechanism underlying the characteristic selective degeneration and death of motor neurons in this common adult motor neuron disease has remained a mystery. There is no effective remedy for this progressive, fatal disorder. Modern genetics has now identified mutations in one gene [Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1)] as a primary cause and implicated others [encoding neurofilaments, cytoplasmic dynein and its processivity factor dynactin, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)] as contributors to, or causes of, motor neuron diseases. These insights have enabled development of model systems to test hypotheses of disease mechanism and potential therapies. Along with errors in the handling of synaptic glutamate and the potential excitotoxic response this provokes, these model systems highlight the involvement of nonneuronal cells in disease progression and provide new therapeutic strategies.
motor_neuron_disease	VEGF	Positive	PMID:15003169	Sopher BL, Thomas PS Jr, LaFevre-Bernt MA, Holm IE, Wilke SA, Ware CB, Jin LW, Libby RT, Ellerby LM, La Spada AR: Androgen receptor YAC transgenic mice recapitulate SBMA motor neuronopathy and implicate VEGF164 in the motor neuron degeneration. Neuron. 2004 Mar 4;41(5):687-99. X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is an inherited neuromuscular disorder characterized by lower motor neuron degeneration. SBMA is caused by polyglutamine repeat expansions in the androgen receptor (AR). To determine the basis of AR polyglutamine neurotoxicity, we introduced human AR yeast artificial chromosomes carrying either 20 or 100 CAGs into mouse embryonic stem cells. The AR100 transgenic mice developed a late-onset, gradually progressive neuromuscular phenotype accompanied by motor neuron degeneration, indicating striking recapitulation of the human disease. We then tested the hypothesis that polyglutamine-expanded AR interferes with CREB binding protein (CBP)-mediated transcription of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and observed altered CBP-AR binding and VEGF reduction in AR100 mice. We found that mutant AR-induced death of motor neuron-like cells could be rescued by VEGF. Our results suggest that SBMA motor neuronopathy involves altered expression of VEGF, consistent with a role for VEGF as a neurotrophic/survival factor in motor neuron disease.
omphalocele	CD34	Negative	PMID:11435469	Doyonnas R, Kershaw DB, Duhme C, Merkens H, Chelliah S, Graf T, McNagny KM: Anuria, omphalocele, and perinatal lethality in mice lacking the CD34-related protein podocalyxin. J Exp Med. 2001 Jul 2;194(1):13-27. Podocalyxin is a CD34-related sialomucin that is expressed at high levels by podocytes, and also by mesothelial cells, vascular endothelia, platelets, and hematopoietic stem cells. To elucidate the function of podocalyxin, we generated podocalyxin-deficient (podxl (-/)-) mice by homologous recombination. Null mice exhibit profound defects in kidney development and die within 24 hours of birth with anuric renal failure. Although podocytes are present in the glomeruli of the podxl (-/)- mice, they fail to form foot processes and slit diaphragms and instead exhibit cell--cell junctional complexes (tight and adherens junctions). The corresponding reduction in permeable, glomerular filtration surface area presumably leads to the observed block in urine production. In addition, podxl (-/)- mice frequently display herniation of the gut (omphalocele), suggesting that podocalyxin may be required for retraction of the gut from the umbilical cord during development. Hematopoietic and vascular endothelial cells develop normally in the podocalyxin-deficient mice, possibly through functional compensation by other sialomucins (such as CD34). Our results provide the first example of an essential role for a sialomucin in development and suggest that defects in podocalyxin could play a role in podocyte dysfunction in renal failure and omphalocele in humans.
omphalocele	acetylcholinesterase	Negative	PMID:7130957	Guibaud S, Simplot A, Bonnet M, Thoulon JM, Guibaud P, Robert JM: [Acetylcholinesterase of amniotic fluid: application to prenatal diagnosis of neural tube closing defects. J Genet Hum. 1982 Mar;30(1):51-9. I. Quantitative tests]. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in amniotic fluid from 165 normal pregnancies and 38 abnormal pregnancies was measured, using a direct assay of AChE activity after inhibition of ChnS with ethopropozine ("Lysivane"). Samples from normal pregnancies of 16-24 weeks gestation have a mean AChE activity of 2,7 U/1 and those obtained at 26-40 weeks have a mean level of 0,6 U/l. Contamination of amniotic fluid with fetal or maternal blood was observed to elevate AChE activity leading to uninterpretable results. Assays in artificial mixtures of amniotic fluid with maternal or fetal blood confirm the risk related to added erythrocyte number. Higher mean AChE activity, 8 U/l, was observed in association with open NTD, but in 7 cases the level was as in normal pregnancy. Elevated levels of AChE were found in association with Turner's syndrome (1) and intra uterine death (2); no increase was observed in 7 cases of omphalocele or laparoschisis, in 6 cases of atresia and 2 cases of hydrocephaly. In practice frequent occurence of bloody samples, specially from abnormal pregnancies, limits application of the test for antenatal open NTD diagnosis. This test appears as and useful preliminary stage providing informations for realization and interpretation of gel electrophoresis of cholinesterases.
omphalocele	acetylcholinesterase	Negative	PMID:6171116	Grob PJ: [Alpha-1-fetoprotein screening--development and problems] . Soz Praventivmed. 1981 Sep;26(4):217-20. Principle and logistic of alpha-1-fetoprotein (AFP-) screening is explained. It is estimated that approximately 2% of women pregnant for 16 to 18 weeks have elevated circulating AFP. By again measuring serum-AFP and by ultrasound examination such abnormal values can be explained by multiple pregnancies, wrongly estimated duration of pregnancy, abortus, etc, in approximately half of the cases. In 0.8 to 1% of all pregnant women the high-serum-AFP remains unexplained and an amniocentesis is indicated. An elevated amniotic AFP (0.1 to 0.2% of all pregnant women) strongly points to a fetus with an open neural tube defect. By also measuring amniotic acetylcholinesterase, this diagnosis can be distinguished from other fetal abnormalities associated with high amniotic AFP, such as omphalocele.
omphalocele	transcobalamin-II	Positive	PMID:15937947	Mills JL, Druschel CM, Pangilinan F, Pass K, Cox C, Seltzer RR, Conley MR, Brody LC: Folate-related genes and omphalocele. Am J Med Genet A. 2005 Jul 1;136(1):8-11. Women who take folic acid in the periconceptional period greatly reduce their chances of having a child with a neural tube defect (NTD). Using multivitamins may also reduce the risk of having a child with an omphalocele. In this study, we tested single nucleotide polymorphisms in folate-related enzyme genes for association with omphalocele. Polymorphisms in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (MTHFD1), the reduced folate carrier (SLC19A1), and transcobalamin II (TCN2) were examined in 25 children with euploid omphalocele and 59 matched controls. Omphalocele cases were significantly more likely to carry the T allele of MTHFR 677C--> T, a known risk factor for NTDs (odds ratio 3.50, 95% confidence interval 1.07-11.47, P=0.035). The MTHFD1 R653Q, SLC19A1 R27H, and TCN2 P259R polymorphisms showed no significant association with omphalocele. In this small study, the thermolabile variant of MTHFR, 677C--> T, was associated with an increased risk for omphalocele. This variant causes reduced enzyme activity, thus suggesting a mechanism by which multivitamins with folic acid might prevent omphalocele. Additional investigation is required.

Dev Biol. 2002 Mar 1;243(1):185-206. The type 1 Simpson-Golabi-Behmel overgrowth syndrome (SGBS1) is caused by loss-of-function mutations of the X-linked GPC3 gene encoding glypican-3, a cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan that apparently plays a negative role in growth control by an unknown mechanism. Mice carrying a Gpc3 gene knockout exhibited several phenotypic features that resemble clinical hallmarks of SGBS1, including somatic overgrowth, renal dysplasia, accessory spleens, polydactyly, and placentomegaly. In Gpc3/DeltaH19 double mutants (lacking GPC3 and also carrying a deletion around the H19 gene region that causes bialellic expression of the closely linked Igf2 gene by imprint relaxation), the Gpc3-null phenotype was exacerbated, while additional SGBS1 features (omphalocele and skeletal defects) were manifested. However, results from a detailed comparative analysis of growth patterns in double mutants lacking GPC3 and also IGF2, IGF1, or the type 1 IGF receptor (IGF1R) provided conclusive genetic evidence inconsistent with the hypothesis that GPC3 acts as a growth suppressor by sequestering or downregulating an IGF ligand. Nevertheless, our data are compatible with a model positing that there is downstream convergence of the independent signaling pathways in which either IGFs or (indirectly) GPC3 participate.
omphalocele	IGF2	Positive	PMID:9389646	Eggenschwiler J, Ludwig T, Fisher P, Leighton PA, Tilghman SM, Efstratiadis A: Mouse mutant embryos overexpressing IGF-II exhibit phenotypic features of the Beckwith-Wiedemann and Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndromes. Genes Dev. 1997 Dec 1;11(23):3128-42. In mice, the imprinted Igf2 gene (expressed from the paternal allele), which encodes a growth-promoting factor (IGF-II), is linked closely to the reciprocally imprinted H19 locus on chromosome 7. Also imprinted (expressed from the maternal allele) is the Igf2r gene on chromsome 17 encoding the type 2 IGF receptor that is involved in degradation of excess IGF-II. Double mutant embryos carrying a deletion around the H19 region and also a targeted Igf2r allele, both inherited maternally, have extremely high levels of IGF-II (7- and 11-fold higher than normal in tissues and serum, respectively) as a result of biallelic Igf2 expression (imprint relaxation by deletion of H19-associated sequence) in combination with lack of the IGF2R-mediated IGF-II turnover. This excess of IGF-II causes somatic overgrowth, visceromegaly, placentomegaly, omphalocele, and cardiac and adrenal defects, which are also features of the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS), a genetically complex human disorder associated with chromosomal abnormalities in the 11p15.5 region where the IGF2 gene resides. In addition, the double mutant mouse embryos exhibit skeletal defects and cleft palate, which are manifestations observed frequently in the Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome, another overgrowth disorder overlapping phenotypically, but not genetically, with BWS.

Dev Biol. 2002 Mar 1;243(1):185-206. The type 1 Simpson-Golabi-Behmel overgrowth syndrome (SGBS1) is caused by loss-of-function mutations of the X-linked GPC3 gene encoding glypican-3, a cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan that apparently plays a negative role in growth control by an unknown mechanism. Mice carrying a Gpc3 gene knockout exhibited several phenotypic features that resemble clinical hallmarks of SGBS1, including somatic overgrowth, renal dysplasia, accessory spleens, polydactyly, and placentomegaly. In Gpc3/DeltaH19 double mutants (lacking GPC3 and also carrying a deletion around the H19 gene region that causes bialellic expression of the closely linked Igf2 gene by imprint relaxation), the Gpc3-null phenotype was exacerbated, while additional SGBS1 features (omphalocele and skeletal defects) were manifested. However, results from a detailed comparative analysis of growth patterns in double mutants lacking GPC3 and also IGF2, IGF1, or the type 1 IGF receptor (IGF1R) provided conclusive genetic evidence inconsistent with the hypothesis that GPC3 acts as a growth suppressor by sequestering or downregulating an IGF ligand. Nevertheless, our data are compatible with a model positing that there is downstream convergence of the independent signaling pathways in which either IGFs or (indirectly) GPC3 participate.
omphalocele	SLC19A1	Positive	PMID:15937947	Mills JL, Druschel CM, Pangilinan F, Pass K, Cox C, Seltzer RR, Conley MR, Brody LC: Folate-related genes and omphalocele. Am J Med Genet A. 2005 Jul 1;136(1):8-11. Women who take folic acid in the periconceptional period greatly reduce their chances of having a child with a neural tube defect (NTD). Using multivitamins may also reduce the risk of having a child with an omphalocele. In this study, we tested single nucleotide polymorphisms in folate-related enzyme genes for association with omphalocele. Polymorphisms in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (MTHFD1), the reduced folate carrier (SLC19A1), and transcobalamin II (TCN2) were examined in 25 children with euploid omphalocele and 59 matched controls. Omphalocele cases were significantly more likely to carry the T allele of MTHFR 677C--> T, a known risk factor for NTDs (odds ratio 3.50, 95% confidence interval 1.07-11.47, P=0.035). The MTHFD1 R653Q, SLC19A1 R27H, and TCN2 P259R polymorphisms showed no significant association with omphalocele. In this small study, the thermolabile variant of MTHFR, 677C--> T, was associated with an increased risk for omphalocele. This variant causes reduced enzyme activity, thus suggesting a mechanism by which multivitamins with folic acid might prevent omphalocele. Additional investigation is required.

omphalocele	alpha-fetoprotein	Positive	PMID:10420042	Forrester MB, Merz RD: Impact of demographic factors on prenatal diagnosis and elective pregnancy termination because of abdominal wall defects, Hawaii, 1986-1997. Fetal Diagn Ther. 1999 Jul-Aug;14(4):206-11. OBJECTIVE: The intent of this study was to investigate the impact of various demographic factors on the antenatal diagnosis and elective termination of abdominal wall defect pregnancies. METHOD: Data were obtained from a birth defects registry in Hawaii between 1986 and 1997. RESULTS: The antenatal diagnosis rate was higher for gastroschisis than for omphalocele (76 vs. 60%). However, gastroschisis pregnancies were substantially less frequently electively terminated than omphalocele pregnancies (8 vs. 29%). Factors such as year of diagnosis and delivery, maternal age, race/ethnicity, residence, and maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein screening affected the prenatal diagnosis and/or elective termination of both omphalocele and gastroschisis pregnancies, but frequently in different ways. CONCLUSION: This investigation determined that antenatal diagnosis and elective termination varied with the type of abdominal wall defect and selected demographic factors.
omphalocele	alpha-fetoprotein	Positive	PMID:7524003	Saller DN Jr, Canick JA, Palomaki GE, Knight GJ, Haddow JE: Second-trimester maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein, unconjugated estriol, and hCG levels in pregnancies with ventral wall defects. Obstet Gynecol. 1994 Nov;84(5):852-5. OBJECTIVE: To determine if second-trimester maternal serum concentrations of unconjugated estriol (E3) and hCG are altered in pregnancies associated with fetal gastroschisis or omphalocele. METHODS: Concentrations of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), unconjugated E3, and hCG were measured in a case-control study involving 23 cases of gastroschisis, 17 cases of omphalocele, and 200 matched unaffected pregnancies. RESULTS: As reported previously, median AFP levels were significantly higher in pregnancies with gastroschisis and omphalocele compared to unaffected pregnancies (9.42 and 4.18 multiples of the unaffected population median [MoM], respectively). The median hCG values were not significantly different for the two defects (1.10 and 1.13 MoM, respectively). Six of the cases of omphalocele were associated with other anomalies, but exclusion of these cases from the analysis did not alter the conclusions. CONCLUSIONS: Unconjugated E3 and hCG measurements are not useful in screening for, or distinguishing between, open ventral wall defects. Alpha-fetoprotein measurements alone will detect nearly all cases of gastroschisis and most cases of omphalocele.
omphalocele	alpha-fetoprotein	Positive	PMID:6191039	Schaffer RM, Barone C, Friedman AP: The ultrasonographic spectrum of fetal omphalocele. J Ultrasound Med. 1983 May;2(5):219-22. Four cases of fetal omphalocele diagnosed in utero by ultrasonography represent variations in the sonographic appearance of this rare anomaly. A possible pathogenesis of omphalocele is presented, with a discussion of the associated complications and the effect of diagnosing omphalocele prenatally on the management of the pregnancy itself. The association between fetal omphalocele and elevated alpha-fetoprotein is significant, and may prompt a search for a small omphalocele that would otherwise be missed on a routine obstetric sonogram. The differentiation of omphalocele from gastroschisis is difficult, yet the two anomalies can be reliably differentiated sonographically.
omphalocele	alpha-fetoprotein	Positive	PMID:6171116	Grob PJ: [Alpha-1-fetoprotein screening--development and problems] . Soz Praventivmed. 1981 Sep;26(4):217-20. Principle and logistic of alpha-1-fetoprotein (AFP-) screening is explained. It is estimated that approximately 2% of women pregnant for 16 to 18 weeks have elevated circulating AFP. By again measuring serum-AFP and by ultrasound examination such abnormal values can be explained by multiple pregnancies, wrongly estimated duration of pregnancy, abortus, etc, in approximately half of the cases. In 0.8 to 1% of all pregnant women the high-serum-AFP remains unexplained and an amniocentesis is indicated. An elevated amniotic AFP (0.1 to 0.2% of all pregnant women) strongly points to a fetus with an open neural tube defect. By also measuring amniotic acetylcholinesterase, this diagnosis can be distinguished from other fetal abnormalities associated with high amniotic AFP, such as omphalocele.
omphalocele	alpha-fetoprotein	Positive	PMID:6170192	Weise W, Hemke G: [Cause for increased alpha-fetoprotein values in amniotic fluid in prenatal diagnosis of genetic defects (author's transl)]. Zentralbl Gynakol. 1981;103(13):740-50. Alpha-fetoprotein measurement was undertaken in 1,582 instances, with 957 tests being applied to 776 patients for prenatal diagnosis of genetic defects, against the background of various indications - increased alpha-fetoprotein levels were recorded from the amniotic fluid of 24 patients (3.1 per cent). Values were defined as being increased, when they had exceeded threefold standard deviation from normal mean values. The causes underlying increased alpha-fetoprotein levels included six cases of anencephalia, one case of Turner's syndrome, one omphalocele, one intra-uterine foetal death, and one puncturing injury to a foetus. No foetal malformation or other foetal disorder, known to be accompanied by increased alpha-fetoprotein values, was recordable from 14 patients. Displacement of the pathological limit value to data five times the standard deviation reduced the number of erroneously positive findings to 0.8 per cent. Possibilities are discussed for differential of increased alpha-fetoprotein values. The proposal is made to respond to increased alpha-fetoprotein levels by another intensive ultrasonic B-scan test, control puncture, and, in certain cases, amniofetography.
omphalocele	alpha-fetoprotein	Positive	PMID:6169278	Fisher NL, Luthy DA, Peterson A, Karp LE, Williamson R, Cheng E: Prenatal diagnosis of neural tube defects: predictive value of AF-AFP in a low-risk population. Am J Med Genet. 1981;9(3):201-9. Amniotic fluid alpha-fetoprotein (AF-AFP) determinations were performed on 1,215 women who were at low risk for fetal neural tube defects and who were undergoing mid-trimester amniocentesis for cytogenetic indications, primarily age-related aneuploidy. Maternal sera obtained before amniocentesis and amniotic fluids were assayed in duplicate for alpha-fetoprotein by radioimmunoassay. Of the 1,215 low-risk women, eight (0.7%) had significant elevations of AF-AFP (greater than or equal to +5 SD). In none of the cases was the elevation associated with a fetal neural tube defect. Two cases with elevated AF-AFP were associated with chromosome aberrations; one with impending fetal demise; one with fetal blood contamination; and one case was due to a laboratory error. In one case, no source for the elevated AFP was found, and a normal infant was delivered at term. In the final two cases, the cause of the elevated AF-AFP was a fetal abdominal wall defect (one gastroschisis and one omphalocele). The predictive value of an elevated AFP varies with the population screened, and is reduced by routine ultrasonography before amniocentesis, which at least identifies anencephaly. In a low-risk population, an elevated AF-AFP is most often not associated with a fetal neural tube defect. Because of the low predictive value and the nonspecificity of AF-AFP, genetic counselors should reconsider the recommendation of routine AF-AFP in low-risk maternal populations.
omphalocele	alpha-fetoprotein	Positive	PMID:2453005	Palomaki GE, Hill LE, Knight GJ, Haddow JE, Carpenter M: Second-trimester maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein levels in pregnancies associated with gastroschisis and omphalocele. Obstet Gynecol. 1988 Jun;71(6 Pt 1):906-9. This population-based study analyzes maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) distributions for 20 cases of gastroschisis and 13 cases of omphalocele occurring in singleton pregnancies from among 72,782 second-trimester pregnancies in Maine and Rhode Island screened consecutively between January 1, 1979 and February 28, 1987. Median values (and ranges) for the two lesions were 4.1 multiples of the median (0.5-29.8) for omphalocele and 7.0 multiples of the median (3.6-13.5) for gastroschisis. The MSAFP distributions for the two conditions were both log-Gaussian, and the log standard deviation was smaller for gastroschisis than for omphalocele. The MSAFP screening sensitivity was greater for gastroschisis than for omphalocele at any given cutoff, and the overall sensitivity of this screening process for detecting open ventral wall defects will differ, therefore, depending upon the relative proportion of gastroschisis and omphalocele cases that occur in the screened population.
omphalocele	alpha-fetoprotein	Positive	PMID:74953	King CR, Prescott GH: Amniotic fluid alpha-fetoprotein elevation with fetal omphalocele and a possible mechanism for its occurrence. Am J Obstet Gynecol. 1978 Feb 1;130(3):279-83. Prenatal diagnosis of genetic disease and congenital malformations has become a major area of study in obstetrics. The assessment of amniotic fluid alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is useful for the diagnosis of neural tube defects. As more patients have been evaluated abnormal increases have been found in other defects, such as omphalocele, duodenal atresia, and congenital nephrosis. Two patients with omphalocele are reported with AFP measurement. A tenfold elevation of AFP was found in the first patient. In the second case a small omphalocele associated with exstrophy of the cloaca was not accompanied by an abnormal AFP increase. The mechanism of AFP elevation is discussed.
omphalocele	Alk3	Positive	PMID:17588538	Sun J, Liu YH, Chen H, Nguyen MP, Mishina Y, Upperman JS, Ford HR, Shi W: Deficient Alk3-mediated BMP signaling causes prenatal omphalocele-like defect. Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2007 Aug 17;360(1):238-43. Epub 2007 Jun 15. BMP signaling plays important roles in many embryonic developmental processes. Alk3 is one of two BMP type I receptors that transduces BMP signal from the cell surface into cell. Conventional knockout of Alk3 resulted in early embryonic lethality around E7.5-E9.5. In this study, we have generated embryonic mesoderm-specific Alk3 conditional knockout by crossing Dermo1-Cre and floxed Alk3 mice. Abrogation of Alk3-mediated BMP signaling in this mouse resulted in severe defect of secondary ventral body wall formation, replicating the omphalocele phenotype in human. Our finding suggests that Alk3 plays an essential role in the formation of embryonic ventral abdominal wall, and abrogation of BMP signaling activity due to gene mutations in its signaling components could be one of the underlying causes of omphalocele at birth.

Am J Med Genet A. 2005 Jul 1;136(1):8-11. Women who take folic acid in the periconceptional period greatly reduce their chances of having a child with a neural tube defect (NTD). Using multivitamins may also reduce the risk of having a child with an omphalocele. In this study, we tested single nucleotide polymorphisms in folate-related enzyme genes for association with omphalocele. Polymorphisms in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (MTHFD1), the reduced folate carrier (SLC19A1), and transcobalamin II (TCN2) were examined in 25 children with euploid omphalocele and 59 matched controls. Omphalocele cases were significantly more likely to carry the T allele of MTHFR 677C--> T, a known risk factor for NTDs (odds ratio 3.50, 95% confidence interval 1.07-11.47, P=0.035). The MTHFD1 R653Q, SLC19A1 R27H, and TCN2 P259R polymorphisms showed no significant association with omphalocele. In this small study, the thermolabile variant of MTHFR, 677C--> T, was associated with an increased risk for omphalocele. This variant causes reduced enzyme activity, thus suggesting a mechanism by which multivitamins with folic acid might prevent omphalocele. Additional investigation is required.
omphalocele	vesicular-inhibitory-amino-acid-transporter	Positive	PMID:16701208	Wojcik SM, Katsurabayashi S, Guillemin I, Friauf E, Rosenmund C, Brose N, Rhee JS: A shared vesicular carrier allows synaptic corelease of GABA and glycine. . Neuron. 2006 May 18;50(4):575-87. The type of vesicular transporter expressed by a neuron is thought to determine its neurotransmitter phenotype. We show that inactivation of the vesicular inhibitory amino acid transporter (Viaat, VGAT) leads to embryonic lethality, an abdominal defect known as omphalocele, and a cleft palate. Loss of Viaat causes a drastic reduction of neurotransmitter release in both GABAergic and glycinergic neurons, indicating that glycinergic neurons do not express a separate vesicular glycine transporter. This loss of GABAergic and glycinergic synaptic transmission does not impair the development of inhibitory synapses or the expression of KCC2, the K+ -Cl- cotransporter known to be essential for the establishment of inhibitory neurotransmission. In the absence of Viaat, GABA-synthesizing enzymes are partially lost from presynaptic terminals. Since GABA and glycine compete for vesicular uptake, these data point to a close association of Viaat with GABA-synthesizing enzymes as a key factor in specifying GABAergic neuronal phenotypes.

Am J Med Genet A. 2004 Oct 15;130(3):277-83. Omphalocele is a congenital anomaly with substantial morbidity. Rieger syndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder, is characterized by craniofacial abnormalities and abdominal wall defects. PITX2 mutations are etiologic in > 40% of cases of Rieger syndrome. We demonstrate that the birth prevalence of omphalocele is significantly higher in Rieger syndrome than in the general population, with omphaloceles found in 0.03% in the Iowa newborn population and 4.3% of patients with Rieger syndrome. Our objective was to screen coding and conserved non-coding regions of PITX2 for mutations in 209 patients with omphalocele. We identified remarkable evolutionarily conserved regions by comparing the 3'UTR of Pitx2 in 13 vertebrate and 3 invertebrate species. No mutations changing the amino acid sequence were found within the omphalocele population. In one case of omphalocele with VATER-like additional anomalies, a three nucleotide deletion was found in the 3'UTR. This deletion was not seen in 1,186 controls. Also in the 3'UTR, we identified a single nucleotide polymorphism at a highly conserved residue. Our findings suggest additional studies of PITX2 conserved regions will be valuable. We also screened the omphalocele cases for mutations in exon 5 of the gene FLNA. Mutations in FLNA have been shown to cause a broad range of congenital malformations, including otopalatodigital syndrome type 2 in which a missense mutation occurring in exon 5 of FLNA results in omphalocele as part of the phenotype. We did not find any mutations in exon 5 of FLNA in 179 omphalocele cases studied.
omphalocele	Calreticulin	Positive	PMID:10085286	Mesaeli N, Nakamura K, Zvaritch E, Dickie P, Dziak E, Krause KH, Opas M, MacLennan DH, Michalak M: Calreticulin is essential for cardiac development. J Cell Biol. 1999 Mar 8;144(5):857-68. Calreticulin is a ubiquitous Ca2+ binding protein, located in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen, which has been implicated in many diverse functions including: regulation of intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis, chaperone activity, steroid-mediated gene regulation, and cell adhesion. To understand the physiological function of calreticulin we used gene targeting to create a knockout mouse for calreticulin. Mice homozygous for the calreticulin gene disruption developed omphalocele (failure of absorption of the umbilical hernia) and showed a marked decrease in ventricular wall thickness and deep intertrabecular recesses in the ventricular walls. Transgenic mice expressing a green fluorescent protein reporter gene under the control of the calreticulin promoter were used to show that the calreticulin gene is highly activated in the cardiovascular system during the early stages of cardiac development. Calreticulin protein is also highly expressed in the developing heart, but it is only a minor component of the mature heart. Bradykinin-induced Ca2+ release by the InsP3-dependent pathway was inhibited in crt-/- cells, suggesting that calreticulin plays a role in Ca2+ homeostasis. Calreticulin-deficient cells also exhibited impaired nuclear import of nuclear factor of activated T cell (NF-AT3) transcription factor indicating that calreticulin plays a role in cardiac development as a component of the Ca2+/calcineurin/NF-AT/GATA-4 transcription pathway.

onchocerciasis	cutaneous-T-cell-attracting-chemokine	Positive	PMID:16232219	Fendt J, Hamm DM, Banla M, Schulz-Key H, Wolf H, Helling-Giese G, Heuschkel C, Soboslay PT: Chemokines in onchocerciasis patients after a single dose of ivermectin. . Clin Exp Immunol. 2005 Nov;142(2):318-26. Ivermectin treatment will effectively diminish microfilariae (Mf) of Onchocerca volvulus in the skin of patients, but therapy is associated with adverse host inflammatory responses. To investigate the association of proinflammatory chemokines with the intensity of infection and clinical adverse reactions, chemokine serum levels were measured in patients following ivermectin treatment (100 microg/kg, 150 microg/kg or 200 microg/kg) or placebo. The density of O. volvulus Mf per mg skin decreased by 85%, 97%, 97% and 90% at day 3, at month 3, month 6 and at 1 year post-ivermectin. The cutaneous T cell-attracting chemokine (CTACK/CCL27) was found highly elevated in onchocerciasis patients compared to infection-free European controls (P = 0.0004) and it did not change following ivermectin or placebo to 1 year post-therapy. The chemokine RANTES/CCL5 (regulated on activated and normally T cell-expressed) was similarly high in onchocerciasis patients and infection-free European controls; the RANTES/CCL5 levels did not change following treatment until 6 months post-therapy but were slightly elevated at 1 year post-therapy (P thymus and activation regulated chemokine (TARC/CCL17) and macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC/CCL22), were activated at 3 days post-ivermectin (P protein (MIP)-1alpha/CCL3 and MIP-1beta/CCL4 were low before ivermectin treatment, but following clearance of microfilariae of O. volvulus their levels increased from 6 months post-therapy onwards (for both at 12 months post-therapy, P ivermectin or with the serum levels of MIP-1alpha/CCL3, MIP-1beta/CCL4, TARC/CCL17, MDC/CCL22 and CTACK/CCL27. Our observations suggest that following ivermectin, macrophages as well as memory Th2-type lymphocytes and B cells, attracted and activated by MDC/CCL22, TARC/CCL17 and CTACK/CCL27, may contribute to dermal immune responses and O. volvulus Mf killing and clearance. The transient changes of TARC/CCL17 and MDC/CCL22 were not associated with clinical adverse responses, and the later rise of MIP-1alpha/CCL3 and MIP-1beta/CCL4 showed a reactivation of Type 1 immune responses associated with persistent low levels of O. volvulus microfilariae and an expiring O. volvulus infection.
onchocerciasis	eosinophil-derived-neurotoxin	Positive	PMID:10206116	Tischendorf FW, Brattig NW, Burchard GD, Kubica T, Kreuzpaintner G, Lintzel M: Eosinophils, eosinophil cationic protein and eosinophil-derived neurotoxin in serum and urine of patients with onchocerciasis coinfected with intestinal nematodes and in urinary schistosomiasis. Acta Trop. 1999 Mar 15;72(2):157-73. Eosinophils, eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN/EPX), myeloperoxidase (MPO) and IgE were measured in blood, serum and/or urine in Schistosoma haematobium- and Onchocerca volvulus-infected Guineans and O. volvulus- and S. haematobium-negative Guineans coinfected or infected with intestinal nematodes. The number of eosinophils and levels of eosinophil granule proteins but not of MPO were found to be strongly elevated in all Africans as compared to European controls. The highest serum ECP and serum and urinary EDN/EPX levels were observed in the hyperreactive form of onchocerciasis (sowda). Onchocerciasis patients and O. volvulus-negative Africans coinfected or infected with intestinal nematodes (hookworm and/or Ascaris lumbricoides) revealed higher serum granule protein concentrations and/or absolute eosinophil counts and urinary ECP than those without nematode infections. Statistical differences between both sections were found for the absolute eosinophil counts and for serum EDN/EPX and IgE in generalized onchocerciasis, and for urinary ECP in sowda, indicating stimulation of the eosinophil potential of O. volvulus-positive patients by coexistent hookworm infection. This worm species, in contrast to A. lumbricoides, causes especially high eosinophil counts and EDN/EPX and IgE levels. From these results it is concluded that in nematode diseases, ECP and EDN/EPX levels reflect the degree of antigenic stimulation, eosinophil activation and eosinophil turnover rates. Serum ECP and serum and urinary EDN/EPX may, therefore, serve as parameters to monitor helminth infection. Urinary ECP may be a marker of eosinophiluria secondary to urogenital manifestation of S. haematobium. It is elevated in hyperreactive onchocerciasis activated by intestinal nematodes.
onchocerciasis	cytokine	Positive	PMID:17302900	Mai CS, Hamm DM, Banla M, Agossou A, Schulz-Key H, Heuschkel C, Soboslay PT: Onchocerca volvulus-specific antibody and cytokine responses in onchocerciasis patients after 16 years of repeated ivermectin therapy. Clin Exp Immunol. 2007 Mar;147(3):504-12. The recommended control option against onchocerciasis is repeated ivermectin treatment, which will need to be implemented for decades, and it remains unknown how repeated ivermectin therapy might affect immunity against Onchocerca volvulus in the long term. O. volvulus-specific antibody reactivity and cellular cytokine production were investigated in onchocerciasis patients receiving ivermectin (150 microg/kg) annually for 16 years. In treated patients, the T helper type 2 (Th2) cytokine interleukin (IL)-5 and T regulatory IL-10 in response to O. volvulus antigen (OvAg) and bacteria-derived Streptolysin O (SL-O) diminished to levels found in infection-free endemic controls; also, cellular release of Th1-type interferon (IFN)-gamma at 16 years post initial ivermectin treatment (p.i.t.) approached control levels. In ivermectin-treated onchocerciasis patients, IL-5 production in responses to the mitogen phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) decreased, but IL-10 in response PHA increased, and neither attained the cytokine production levels of endemic controls. At 16 years p.i.t., O. volvulus-specific IgG1 and IgG4 subclass reactivity still persisted at higher levels in onchocerciasis patients than in O. volvulus exposed but microfilariae-free endemic controls. In addition, cytokine responses remained depressed in onchocerciasis patients infected concurrently with Mansonella perstans and Necator americanus or Entamoeba histolytica/dispar. Thus, long-term ivermectin therapy of onchocerciasis may not suffice to re-establish fully a balanced Th1 and Th2 immune responsiveness in O. volvulus microfilariae-negative individuals. Such deficient reconstitution of immune competence may be due to an as yet continuing and uncontrolled reinfection with O. volvulus, but parasite co-infections can also bias and may prevent the development of such immunity.

The possibility of concomitant immunity and its potential mechanisms in Onchocerca volvulus infection were examined by analyzing cytokine and antibody responses to infective larval (third-stage larvae [L3] and molting L3 [mL3]), adult female worm (F-OvAg), and skin microfilaria (Smf) antigens in infected individuals in a region of hyperendemicity in Cameroon as a function of age. Peripheral blood mononuclear cell interleukin 5 (IL-5) responses to F-OvAg and Smf declined significantly with age (equivalent to years of exposure to O. volvulus). In contrast, IL-5 secretion in response to L3 and mL3 remained elevated with increasing age. Gamma interferon responses to L3, mL3, and F-OvAg were low or suppressed and unrelated to age, except for responses to Smf in older subjects. IL-10 levels were uniformly elevated, regardless of age, in response to L3, mL3, and F-OvAg but not to Smf, for which levels declined with age. A total of 49 to 60% of subjects had granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor responses to all O. volvulus antigens unrelated to age. Analysis of levels of stage-specific immunoglobulin G3 (IgG3) and IgE revealed a striking, age-dependent dissociation between antibody responses to larval antigens (L3 and a recombinant L3-specific protein, O. volvulus ALT-1) which were significantly increased or maintained with age and antibody responses to F-OvAg, which decreased. Levels of IgG1 to L3 and F-OvAg were elevated regardless of age, and levels of IgG4 increased significantly with age, although not to O. volvulus ALT-1, which may have unique L3-specific epitopes. Immunofluorescence staining of whole larvae showed that total anti-L3 immunoglobulin levels also increased with the age of the serum donor. The separate and distinct cytokine and antibody responses to adult and infective larval stages of O. volvulus which are age related are consistent with the acquisition of concomitant immunity in infected individuals.

Clin Exp Immunol. 1999 Jul;117(1):130-7. This study investigated the effect of maternal Onchocerca volvulus infection on humoral and cellular responsiveness in newborn children and their mothers. Onchocerca volvulus-specific IgG isotypes and IgE were significantly elevated in infected mothers and their infants. One year post partum, O. volvulus-specific IgG4 was strongly reduced in children of infected mothers, while IgG1 responses weakened only slightly. Umbilical cord mononuclear blood cells (UCBC) and peripheral blood cells (PBMC) from mothers proliferated in response to phytohaemagglutinin (PHA), concanavalin A (Con A), and the bacterial antigens streptolysin-O (SL-O) or purified protein derivative (PPD). UCBC from neonates born to O. volvulus-infected mothers responded lower (P PPD (at 10 and 50 micrograms/ml) and O. volvulus-derived antigens (OvAg) (at 35 micrograms/ml), and in parallel, a diminished cellular reactivity (P observed to OvAg in mothers positive for O. volvulus. Several Th1-type (IL-2, IL-12, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)) and Th2-type (IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-13) cytokines were secreted by UCBC and PBMC in response to OvAg, bacterial SL-O and PHA. OvAg did not stimulate IL-2 and none of the mitogens or antigens induced production of IL-4 in neonates. In response to OvAg, substantially elevated (P IFN-gamma were produced by UCBC from newborns of O. volvulus-infected mothers. UCBC secreted low levels of IL-5 and IL-13, while higher amounts of IL-10 were found (P onchocerciasis-free mothers. In conclusion, maternal O. volvulus-infection will sensitize in utero parasite-specific cellular immune responsiveness in neonates and activate OvAg-specific production of several Th1- and Th2-type cytokines.
onchocerciasis	cytokine	Positive	PMID:9291349	Brattig N, Nietz C, Hounkpatin S, Lucius R, Seeber F, Pichlmeier U, Pogonka T: Differences in cytokine responses to Onchocerca volvulus extract and recombinant Ov33 and OvL3-1 proteins in exposed subjects with various parasitologic and clinical states. J Infect Dis. 1997 Sep;176(3):838-42. Subjects with generalized onchocerciasis (GEN), with the sowdah form, and with exposure but without onchocerciasis (endemic normal/putatively immune; EN/PI) were studied for cytokine responses to Onchocerca volvulus extract (OvAg) and recombinant Ov33 and OvL3-1 proteins. Higher levels of cytokines were produced in response to OvAgs in sowdah and EN/PI than in GEN subjects. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells did not produce interferon-gamma in response to antigens. OvAg induced interleukin (IL)-5, IL-2, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and soluble IL-2 receptor. EN/PI and sowdah persons produced significantly more IL-5 and IL-2 than GEN subjects, and EN/PI subjects had significantly higher GM-CSF levels than GEN persons. The low IL-5 and GM-CSF levels in GEN subjects were increased by addition of exogenous IL-2. Ov33 and OvL3-1 stimulated production of IL-10 and less IL-5 and IL-2. The study groups did not show a strict Th2-like cytokine response.

Clin Exp Immunol. 1994 May;96(2):238-44. The present study examined the quantitative and qualitative changes registered in the parasite-specific antibody response, cellular reactivity and cytokine production profile in onchocerciasis patients repeatedly treated with ivermectin over a period of 8 years. The densities of Onchocerca volvulus microfilariae (mf) in treated patients remained significantly reduced, whereas the number of permanently amicrofilaridermic patients (subclinical infection) increased with repeated treatments. In vitro cellular responses to O. volvulus antigen (OvAg) were highest (P volvulus (endemic normals). Cellular reactivity in repeatedly treated patients was higher at 84 than at 36 months post initial treatment (p.i.t); furthermore, the proliferative responses to OvAg, mycobacterial purified protein derivative (PPD) and streptococcal SL-O were greater (P onchocerciasis patients. In amicrofilaridermic patients such reactivity approached the magnitude observed in endemic normals. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from patients and endemic normals produced equivalent amounts of IL-2, IL-4 and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in response to mitogenic stimulation with phytohaemagglutinin (PHA); in response to OvAg, however, significantly more IL-2 and IFN-gamma were produced by PBMC from subclinical amicrofilaridermic patients or endemic normals than by mf-positive patients. OvAg-specific production of IL-4 by PBMC from treated patients was lower at 84 than at 36 months p.i.t. At three months p.i.t. the titres of circulating OvAg-specific IgG1-3 had increased (P declined with repeated treatments. Only IgG1 and IgG4 bound to OvAg of mol. wt 2-12 kD at 1 month p.i.t., while recognition of OvAg of mol. wt 10-200 kD by IgG1, IgG2 and IgG4 reached a maximum intensity at 3-6 months p.i.t., with the overall intensity of binding to OvAg gradually weakening thereafter. These results suggest that onchocerciasis-associated immunosuppression is reversible following ivermectin-induced permanent clearance of microfilariae from the skin; and that a vigorous parasite-specific cellular reactivity and a sustained production of IL-2 and IFN-gamma in amicrofilaridermic individuals may contribute to controlling O. volvulus infection.

J Infect Dis. 1994 Oct;170(4):962-70. Cytokine production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells after antigen or mitogen stimulation was assessed before and after semiannual ivermectin treatment of 27 patients with onchocerciasis. Before treatment, Onchocerca volvulus antigen (OvA) elicited interleukin (IL)-5 production but inhibited production of IL-10, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Six months after the first dose of ivermectin, there were increases in the IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, and interferon-gamma responses to mitogen and in the GM-CSF and IL-10 responses to OvA. By 24 months (after four ivermectin doses), OvA-induced GM-CSF production and mitogen-induced IL-2 and IL-10 production remained elevated above pretreatment levels, whereas that of other cytokines returned to or below pretreatment levels. These transient changes in cytokine response profiles of patients with onchocerciasis following ivermectin treatment likely reflect changes in antigen load.
onchocerciasis	cytokine	Positive	PMID:1918387	Limaye AP, Abrams JS, Silver JE, Awadzi K, Francis HF, Ottesen EA, Nutman TB: Interleukin-5 and the posttreatment eosinophilia in patients with onchocerciasis. J Clin Invest. 1991 Oct;88(4):1418-21. To understand the role of the eosinophilopoietic cytokine IL-5 in humans, the posttreatment eosinophilic response in a group of microfilaria (mf)-positive patients with onchocerciasis (n = 10) was examined before and after treatment with diethylcarbamazine (6 mg/kg for 7 d). Sequential blood samples were assessed at 24 and 1 h before treatment (baseline values), then at frequent intervals over the next 14 d. Symptom scores, skin microfilariae (mf), and peripheral blood eosinophil counts were recorded as a function of time after treatment, and serum levels of IL-5 were quantitated by a highly sensitive (sensitivity greater than or equal to 20 pg/ml) monoclonal-based ELISA. Pretreatment eosinophil counts ranged from 240 to 1,186 eosinophils/microliter (geometric mean, 675), and the mf counts from 10 to 218 per mg skin (geometric mean, 79). After an initial decline in the peripheral eosinophil count to 28 +/- 8% of pretreatment levels at 8 h after beginning treatment, the eosinophil counts steadily increased over the next 2 wk, reaching a maximum at 14 d (257 +/- 38% of pretreatment levels). Serum levels of IL-5 rose sharply from pretreatment levels to a peak of 70.5 +/- 11 pg/ml by 24 h after treatment. Serum IL-5 remained elevated over the next 2-3 d and declined toward baseline by approximately 6 d after treatment, at which time the eosinophil levels were steadily increasing. IL-3 and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor, two other cytokines implicated in eosinophilopoeisis, were not detectable in the serum at any time before or after treatment. The rise in serum IL-5 before the posttreatment eosinophilia seen in this group of patients with onchocerciasis demonstrates a temporal relationship between IL-5 and the subsequent development of eosinophilia and implicates IL-5 as an important mediator of eosinophilia in humans.
onchocerciasis	ALT-2	Negative	PMID:15611611	Ramachandran S, Kumar MP, Rami RM, Chinnaiah HB, Nutman T, Kaliraj P, McCarthy J: The larval specific lymphatic filarial ALT-2: induction of protection using protein or DNA vaccination. Microbiol Immunol. 2004;48(12):945-55. Genes from the infective stage of lymphatic filarial parasites expressed at the time of host invasion have been identified as potential vaccine candidates. By screening an L3 cDNA library with sera from uninfected longstanding residents of an area endemic for onchocerciasis, so-called "endemic normals" (EN), we have cloned and characterized one such gene termed the abundant larval transcript two (ALT-2). The stage specificity of ALT-2 gene transcription and protein synthesis was confirmed by PCR using genespecific primers, and by western blot analysis of protein extracts from various stages of the parasite life cycle using specific antisera. Significant differences in antibody response to the recombinant ALT-2 were observed in endemic populations with differing clinical manifestations of lymphatic filariasis with an antibody response present in sera from 18 of 25 (72%) EN subjects compared to 9 of 25 (36%) with subclinical microfilaracmia (MF) and 14 of 25 (52%) of those with chronic lymphatic obstruction (CP) (P=0.01 for comparison of EN to CP or to MF). This differential responsiveness suggests that the protective immunity postulated to account for their uninfected status might be associated with a response to this protein. When the utility of ALT-2 as a vaccine candidate was tested in a murine model using either recombinant protein or a DNA vaccine construct, statistically significant protection was observed when compared to a control filarial gene product expressed across all stages of the parasite lifecycle (SXP-1; P=0.02 for protein and P=0.01 for the DNA vaccine) or compared to adjuvant alone. This level of protection indicates that this vaccine is a promising candidate for further development.
onchocerciasis	OV-1	Negative	PMID:7690712	Chandrashekar R, Ogunrinade AF, Henry RW, Lustigman S, Weil GJ: Onchocerca volvulus: monoclonal antibodies to immune complex-associated parasite antigens. Exp Parasitol. 1993 Sep;77(2):224-34. Improved methods for diagnosis of onchocerciasis are needed. We have recently identified immune complex-associated parasite antigens in sera from onchocerciasis patients. The goal of this study was to produce monoclonal antibodies to these antigens that might be used in antigen detection assays. Two monoclonal antibodies (OV-1 and OV-5) that bind to parasite antigens in immunoblots of PEG-precipitated immune complexes from human onchocerciasis sera and to corresponding antigens in adult worm extracts and excretory-secretory products were produced. The target epitopes of the monoclonals are heat stable, resistant to trypsin, and destroyed by Pronase. The two monoclonals produce similar but not identical patterns of binding to immunoblots of Onchocerca volvulus adult worm antigen with major bands at 43-47, 58-63, and 70 kDa. OV-1 and OV-5 appear to bind to two distinct but closely related epitopes, neither of which is phosphorylcholine. Immunoelectron microscopy showed that the epitopes recognized by these monoclonals are widely distributed in adult female worms, but concentrated in the uterus and intestine. Antigen assays based on these antibodies detected parasite antigen in 9 of 14 sera from onchocerciasis patients, but significant background signal was detected in some nonendemic human sera. Thus, although this study has provided new information on parasite antigens in sera from onchocerciasis patients, additional work will be needed to achieve the goal of producing a sensitive and specific antigen diagnostic test for onchocerciasis.
onchocerciasis	IFN-gamma	Positive	PMID:10722581	Turaga PS, Tierney TJ, Bennett KE, McCarthy MC, Simonek SC, Enyong PA, Moukatte DW, Lustigman S: Immunity to onchocerciasis: cells from putatively immune individuals produce enhanced levels of interleukin-5, gamma interferon, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor in response to Onchocerca volvulus larval and male worm antigens. Infect Immun. 2000 Apr;68(4):1905-11. Antigen-specific interleukin-5 (IL-5), gamma interferon (IFN-gamma), and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) responses in individuals living in an area of hyperendemicity for onchocerciasis in Cameroon were examined. The responses against antigens prepared from Onchocerca volvulus third-stage larvae (L3), molting L3 (mL3), and crude extract from adult males (M-OvAg) were compared to the responses against antigens from adult female worms and skin microfilariae. Cytokine responses for the putatively immune individuals (PI) and the infected individuals (INF) were compared. A differential cytokine profile of IL-5 (Th2 phenotype) and IFN-gamma (Th1 phenotype) was found in these individuals in response to the antigens. In both the PI and the INF, Th2 responses against all the antigens tested were dominant. However, in the PI group as a whole, there was an enhanced Th2 response against the larval antigens and the adult male and adult female antigens, and a Th1 response in a subgroup of the PI (27 to 54.5%) against L3, mL3, and M-OvAg antigens was present. While the PI produced significantly higher levels of GM-CSF against L3, mL3, and M-OvAg antigens than the INF, there was no difference in the GM-CSF responses of the groups against the other antigens. The present study indicated that, in comparison to the INF, the PI have distinct larva-specific and adult male-specific cytokine responses, thus supporting the premise that immunological studies of the PI would lead to the identification of immune mechanisms and the target genes that play a role in protective immunity.
onchocerciasis	IFN-gamma	Positive	PMID:9717193	Johnson EH, Schynder-Candrian S, Rajan TV, Nelson FK, Lustigman S, Abraham D: Immune responses to third stage larvae of Onchocerca volvulus in interferon-gamma and interleukin-4 knockout mice. Parasite Immunol. 1998 Jul;20(7):319-24. To shed clarity on the dichotomy of reported results relative to the significance of T helper-1 vs T helper-2 immune responses in onchocerciasis, we compared the survivability of Onchocerca volvulus third-stage larvae (L3) in immunized mice that had either a targeted disruption of the Interleukin-4 or Interferon-gamma gene. Treatment groups consisted of control mice and mice immunized with irradiated O. volvulus L3. All mice were challenged with diffusion chambers containing viable L3. Vaccinated IL-4-/- were unable to kill this larval target. In contrast, vaccinated INF-gamma-/- and C57BL/6 mice, exhibited high levels of killing, had elevated levels of IL-4 and significantly greater numbers of eosinophils in their diffusion chambers than the IL-4-/-. Whereas, levels of IFN-gamma in all three groups of immunized mice were equivalent to those of control mice, levels of IL-5 were elevated, even in the IL-4-/-, indicating that cytokines other than IL-4 were involved in its production. The protective immune response to third-stage larvae of O. volvulus in mice vaccinated with irradiated larvae has an absolute IL-4 requirement.
onchocerciasis	IFN-gamma	Positive	PMID:9176114	Soboslay PT, Geiger SM, Weiss N, Banla M, Luder CG, Dreweck CM, Batchassi E, Boatin BA, Stadler A, Schulz-Key H: The diverse expression of immunity in humans at distinct states of Onchocerca volvulus infection. Immunology. 1997 Apr;90(4):592-9. This study examined the development and persistence of immunity in humans presenting defined states of Onchocerca volvulus infection, i.e. in exposed endemic control individuals without microfilaridermia and clinical disease, in patients with patent or post-patent onchocerciasis, and in patients concurrently infected with Mansonella perstans. Onchocerca volvulus antigen (OvAg)-specific cellular reactivity was significantly diminished in microfilariae (mf)-positive patients, while the highest reactivity was measured in exposed but mf-negative endemic controls, those being free of any clinical signs of onchocercal disease. In patients who became post-patent, responses to OvAg were significantly augmented, but did not approach entirely the magnitude observed in endemic controls. In onchocerciasis patients with concurrent mansonelliasis, cellular unresponsiveness to OvAg persisted, even when mf of O. volvulus were eliminated permanently by repeated ivermectin therapy. Cells from mf-positive onchocerciasis patients produced significantly less interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) (P interleukin-5 (IL-5) (P IFN-gamma and IL-5 production was similarly high. In contrast, both OvAg-driven as well as spontaneous IL-10 secretion was higher in mf-positive patients than in endemic controls or post-patent cases. In all individuals examined, serological recognition of OvAg by immunoglobulins was dominated by IgG4; in mf-positive patients OvAg of 205,000-12,000 molecular weight (MW) were strongly bound. In post-patent individuals, and similarly in endemic controls. OvAg recognition by IgG4 varied from intense (with numerous antigens being recognized) to weak or absent antigen binding. Significantly elevated OvAg-specific IgG isotypes were measured in mf-positive onchocerciasis patients in comparison with endemic controls or post-patent individuals (with the exception of IgG3). IgG1, IgG2 and IgE were higher, but IgG4 was lower in endemic controls compared with post-patent onchocerciasis patients. The ratios of IgG4/IgG1 differed (P onchocerciasis patients, with IgG4/IgG1 ratios of R volvulus infection. In conclusion, this cross-sectional immunoepidemiological investigation showed that distinct states of O. volvulus infection correlate with a particular cellular and humoral immune response. The mf-free condition appeared to be associated with a vigorous parasite-specific cellular reactivity and a particular cytokine production profile, while concurrent M. perstans infection depressed OvAg-specific cellular responsiveness. Antibody responses, in all likelihood, reflected the intensity and state of infection, and not the degree of acquired immunity protective against parasite aggregation.
onchocerciasis	IFN-gamma	Positive	PMID:8706329	Luder CG, Schulz-Key H, Banla M, Pritze S, Soboslay PT: Immunoregulation in onchocerciasis: predominance of Th1-type responsiveness to low molecular weight antigens of Onchocerca volvulus in exposed individuals without microfilaridermia and clinical disease. Clin Exp Immunol. 1996 Aug;105(2):245-53. Chronic and generalized onchocerciasis is associated with suppression of the parasite-specific cellular responsiveness, while exposed individuals without parasitological and clinical evidence of infection (endemic normals) display prominent cellular reactivity to Onchocerca volvulus antigens (OvAg). In order to identify those parasite antigens which may account for this differential cellular responsiveness, total adult worm-derived OvAg were fractionated by means of preparative SDS-PAGE and blot-elution into 22 antigen fractions of continuously decreasing molecular weight. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from microfilariae (mf)-positive onchocerciasis patients (n = 18) proliferated weakly in response to all OvAg fractions. In contrast, in vitro reactivity of PBMC from endemic normals (n = 9) was depressed in response to OvAg of mol. wt 200-30 kD only, while antigens of mol. wt observed in response to OvAg of mol. wt 15-11 kD. Furthermore, these low mol. wt antigen fractions induced substantial production of IL-2 and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in PBMC from endemic normals, but not in those from onchocerciasis patients. Cells from individuals of both groups secreted similar amounts of IL-5 in response to all OvAg fractions, with highest production again being induced by low mol. wt OvAg. In contrast, PBMC from onchocerciasis patients clearly produced more IL-10 than did cells from endemic normals. This augmented IL-10 production by PBMC from mf-positive individuals was not only observed after stimulation with OvAg fractions, but was measured in unstimulated control cultures as well. IFN-gamma-specific mRNA in antigen-stimulated PBMC from endemic normals appeared to be more prominent than in cells from onchocerciasis patients. However, mRNA transcripts of IL-10 and IL-13 were clearly present in patients, but were absent or inconsistently observed in endemic normals. Our results suggest that vigorous Th1-type cellular responsiveness encountered in endemic normals is restricted to low mol. wt antigens of O. volvulus, while such reactivity will not be present in mf-positive individuals. Furthermore, spontaneous production of high levels of IL-10 in onchocerciasis patients is likely to suppress Th1-type immunity, and thus may favour manifestation of chronic onchocerciasis. These traits of cellular immunity may contribute to the differential outcome of O. volvulus infection, the manifestation of clinical disease, and may also regulate the build up of acquired immunity in humans.

Clin Exp Immunol. 1994 May;96(2):238-44. The present study examined the quantitative and qualitative changes registered in the parasite-specific antibody response, cellular reactivity and cytokine production profile in onchocerciasis patients repeatedly treated with ivermectin over a period of 8 years. The densities of Onchocerca volvulus microfilariae (mf) in treated patients remained significantly reduced, whereas the number of permanently amicrofilaridermic patients (subclinical infection) increased with repeated treatments. In vitro cellular responses to O. volvulus antigen (OvAg) were highest (P volvulus (endemic normals). Cellular reactivity in repeatedly treated patients was higher at 84 than at 36 months post initial treatment (p.i.t); furthermore, the proliferative responses to OvAg, mycobacterial purified protein derivative (PPD) and streptococcal SL-O were greater (P onchocerciasis patients. In amicrofilaridermic patients such reactivity approached the magnitude observed in endemic normals. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from patients and endemic normals produced equivalent amounts of IL-2, IL-4 and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in response to mitogenic stimulation with phytohaemagglutinin (PHA); in response to OvAg, however, significantly more IL-2 and IFN-gamma were produced by PBMC from subclinical amicrofilaridermic patients or endemic normals than by mf-positive patients. OvAg-specific production of IL-4 by PBMC from treated patients was lower at 84 than at 36 months p.i.t. At three months p.i.t. the titres of circulating OvAg-specific IgG1-3 had increased (P declined with repeated treatments. Only IgG1 and IgG4 bound to OvAg of mol. wt 2-12 kD at 1 month p.i.t., while recognition of OvAg of mol. wt 10-200 kD by IgG1, IgG2 and IgG4 reached a maximum intensity at 3-6 months p.i.t., with the overall intensity of binding to OvAg gradually weakening thereafter. These results suggest that onchocerciasis-associated immunosuppression is reversible following ivermectin-induced permanent clearance of microfilariae from the skin; and that a vigorous parasite-specific cellular reactivity and a sustained production of IL-2 and IFN-gamma in amicrofilaridermic individuals may contribute to controlling O. volvulus infection.

J Infect Dis. 1994 Sep;170(3):663-8. Ivermectin treatment of onchocerciasis can induce adverse reactions. Mechanisms underlying these reactions are poorly understood but may include activation of neutrophils. This study investigated the acute-phase response in onchocerciasis patients during 2 days after ivermectin treatment. The acute-phase protein C-reactive protein (CRP) and cytokines that mediate the acute-phase response (tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF alpha] and interleukin-6 [IL-6]) were measured in 144 skin snip-positive onchocerciasis patients and 12 skin snip-negative controls who received one dose of ivermectin (150 micrograms/kg). No elevated TNF alpha levels were found, but IL-6 and CRP were elevated in 25.7% and 50.7% of the patients, respectively, after ivermectin treatment. Most patients (89.2%) with raised IL-6 also had raised CRP. Such increases were not observed in controls and in patients were correlated with adverse reactions and microfilarial densities. These findings suggest a possible role of the acute-phase response in microfilarial destruction following ivermectin treatment.

J Immunol. 2004 Jul 1;173(1):437-45. More than 150 million humans in tropical countries are infected by filarial nematodes which harbor intracellular bacterial endosymbionts of the genus Wolbachia (Rickettsiales). These bacteria have been implicated in adverse effects of drug treatment in filariasis. The present study provides evidence that purified major Wolbachia surface protein (rWSP) acts as an inducer of the innate immune system through TLR2 and TLR4: 1) recombinant, stringently purified rWSP elicited the release of TNF-alpha, IL-12, and IL-8 from cultured blood cells of both Onchocerca volvulus-infected and uninfected people; 2) the inflammatory response to rWSP challenge was TLR2- and TLR4-dependent as demonstrated with TLR-transfected fibroblastoid cells, as well as macrophages and dendritic cells from functional TLR-deficient mice; 3) blood cells of onchocerciasis patients exposed to rWSP also generated down-regulating mediators IL-10 and PGE (2) after 6 days of culture; 4) furthermore, rWSP-reactive IgG1 Abs were present in sera of O. volvulus-infected people but not in those of uninfected Europeans. The lack of rWSP-reactive IgE and IgG4 in serum indicated a bias toward a Th1-type adaptive immune response. Abs against rWSP stained endobacteria in living and degenerating adult O. volvulus filariae, tissue microfilariae and host tissue macrophages that apparently had engulfed microfilariae. Thus, filarial helminths, through products of their endobacteria such as WSP, acquire characteristics of a typical microbial pathogen inducing immune responses via TLR2 and TLR4.

Abs against rWSP stained endobacteria in living and degenerating adult O. volvulus filariae, tissue microfilariae and host tissue macrophages that apparently had engulfed microfilariae. Thus, filarial helminths, through products of their endobacteria such as WSP, acquire characteristics of a typical microbial pathogen inducing immune responses via TLR2 and TLR4.
onchocerciasis	IL-5	Positive	PMID:17302900	Mai CS, Hamm DM, Banla M, Agossou A, Schulz-Key H, Heuschkel C, Soboslay PT: Onchocerca volvulus-specific antibody and cytokine responses in onchocerciasis patients after 16 years of repeated ivermectin therapy. Clin Exp Immunol. 2007 Mar;147(3):504-12. The recommended control option against onchocerciasis is repeated ivermectin treatment, which will need to be implemented for decades, and it remains unknown how repeated ivermectin therapy might affect immunity against Onchocerca volvulus in the long term. O. volvulus-specific antibody reactivity and cellular cytokine production were investigated in onchocerciasis patients receiving ivermectin (150 microg/kg) annually for 16 years. In treated patients, the T helper type 2 (Th2) cytokine interleukin (IL)-5 and T regulatory IL-10 in response to O. volvulus antigen (OvAg) and bacteria-derived Streptolysin O (SL-O) diminished to levels found in infection-free endemic controls; also, cellular release of Th1-type interferon (IFN)-gamma at 16 years post initial ivermectin treatment (p.i.t.) approached control levels. In ivermectin-treated onchocerciasis patients, IL-5 production in responses to the mitogen phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) decreased, but IL-10 in response PHA increased, and neither attained the cytokine production levels of endemic controls. At 16 years p.i.t., O. volvulus-specific IgG1 and IgG4 subclass reactivity still persisted at higher levels in onchocerciasis patients than in O. volvulus exposed but microfilariae-free endemic controls. In addition, cytokine responses remained depressed in onchocerciasis patients infected concurrently with Mansonella perstans and Necator americanus or Entamoeba histolytica/dispar. Thus, long-term ivermectin therapy of onchocerciasis may not suffice to re-establish fully a balanced Th1 and Th2 immune responsiveness in O. volvulus microfilariae-negative individuals. Such deficient reconstitution of immune competence may be due to an as yet continuing and uncontrolled reinfection with O. volvulus, but parasite co-infections can also bias and may prevent the development of such immunity.
onchocerciasis	IL-5	Positive	PMID:10722581	Turaga PS, Tierney TJ, Bennett KE, McCarthy MC, Simonek SC, Enyong PA, Moukatte DW, Lustigman S: Immunity to onchocerciasis: cells from putatively immune individuals produce enhanced levels of interleukin-5, gamma interferon, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor in response to Onchocerca volvulus larval and male worm antigens. Infect Immun. 2000 Apr;68(4):1905-11. Antigen-specific interleukin-5 (IL-5), gamma interferon (IFN-gamma), and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) responses in individuals living in an area of hyperendemicity for onchocerciasis in Cameroon were examined. The responses against antigens prepared from Onchocerca volvulus third-stage larvae (L3), molting L3 (mL3), and crude extract from adult males (M-OvAg) were compared to the responses against antigens from adult female worms and skin microfilariae. Cytokine responses for the putatively immune individuals (PI) and the infected individuals (INF) were compared. A differential cytokine profile of IL-5 (Th2 phenotype) and IFN-gamma (Th1 phenotype) was found in these individuals in response to the antigens. In both the PI and the INF, Th2 responses against all the antigens tested were dominant. However, in the PI group as a whole, there was an enhanced Th2 response against the larval antigens and the adult male and adult female antigens, and a Th1 response in a subgroup of the PI (27 to 54.5%) against L3, mL3, and M-OvAg antigens was present. While the PI produced significantly higher levels of GM-CSF against L3, mL3, and M-OvAg antigens than the INF, there was no difference in the GM-CSF responses of the groups against the other antigens. The present study indicated that, in comparison to the INF, the PI have distinct larva-specific and adult male-specific cytokine responses, thus supporting the premise that immunological studies of the PI would lead to the identification of immune mechanisms and the target genes that play a role in protective immunity.
onchocerciasis	IL-5	Positive	PMID:9294549	Brattig NW, Henkle-Duhrsen KH, Hounkpatin S, Liebau E, Kruppa TF, Zipfel PF: Characterization of human immune responses to the cytosolic superoxide dismutase and glutathione S-transferase from Onchocerca volvulus. Trop Med Int Health. 1997 Aug;2(8):788-98. In onchocerciasis patients and in O. volvulus-exposed individuals without signs of onchocericiasis, T- and B-cell responses to two recombinantly expressed O. volvulus enzymes were analysed and compared to responses to total protein extract of adult parasites. The cytosolic enzymes Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase 1 (OvSOD1) and glutathione S-transferase 2 (OvGST2) represent 2 detoxifying molecules which may play an important role in parasite defense against host-induced oxidative stress. The T-cell response to the two recombinant proteins was analysed by investigating the cytokine responses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Induction of IL-5 at the mRNA level and IL-5 and IL-10 at the protein level was demonstrated in patients with the generalized form of onchocerciasis and endemic normals without clinical manifestations. IFN-gamma was not found to be induced by either antigen. This pattern of lymphokine expression is indicative of a Th2-type response. Compared to patients with the generalized form, a higher level of cytokine induction was observed in the group of endemic normals. Low but significant IgG levels were observed against OvSOD1 in patients with onchocerciasis; higher antibody levels were found against OvGST2 in patients and endemic normals. The highest IgG levels were detected against the crude O. volvulus extract. These results indicate that the two recombinant O. volvulus proteins induce moderate T and B cell responses.
onchocerciasis	IL-5	Positive	PMID:9176114	Soboslay PT, Geiger SM, Weiss N, Banla M, Luder CG, Dreweck CM, Batchassi E, Boatin BA, Stadler A, Schulz-Key H: The diverse expression of immunity in humans at distinct states of Onchocerca volvulus infection. Immunology. 1997 Apr;90(4):592-9. This study examined the development and persistence of immunity in humans presenting defined states of Onchocerca volvulus infection, i.e. in exposed endemic control individuals without microfilaridermia and clinical disease, in patients with patent or post-patent onchocerciasis, and in patients concurrently infected with Mansonella perstans. Onchocerca volvulus antigen (OvAg)-specific cellular reactivity was significantly diminished in microfilariae (mf)-positive patients, while the highest reactivity was measured in exposed but mf-negative endemic controls, those being free of any clinical signs of onchocercal disease. In patients who became post-patent, responses to OvAg were significantly augmented, but did not approach entirely the magnitude observed in endemic controls. In onchocerciasis patients with concurrent mansonelliasis, cellular unresponsiveness to OvAg persisted, even when mf of O. volvulus were eliminated permanently by repeated ivermectin therapy. Cells from mf-positive onchocerciasis patients produced significantly less interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) (P interleukin-5 (IL-5) (P IFN-gamma and IL-5 production was similarly high. In contrast, both OvAg-driven as well as spontaneous IL-10 secretion was higher in mf-positive patients than in endemic controls or post-patent cases. In all individuals examined, serological recognition of OvAg by immunoglobulins was dominated by IgG4; in mf-positive patients OvAg of 205,000-12,000 molecular weight (MW) were strongly bound. In post-patent individuals, and similarly in endemic controls. OvAg recognition by IgG4 varied from intense (with numerous antigens being recognized) to weak or absent antigen binding. Significantly elevated OvAg-specific IgG isotypes were measured in mf-positive onchocerciasis patients in comparison with endemic controls or post-patent individuals (with the exception of IgG3). IgG1, IgG2 and IgE were higher, but IgG4 was lower in endemic controls compared with post-patent onchocerciasis patients. The ratios of IgG4/IgG1 differed (P onchocerciasis patients, with IgG4/IgG1 ratios of R volvulus infection. In conclusion, this cross-sectional immunoepidemiological investigation showed that distinct states of O. volvulus infection correlate with a particular cellular and humoral immune response. The mf-free condition appeared to be associated with a vigorous parasite-specific cellular reactivity and a particular cytokine production profile, while concurrent M. perstans infection depressed OvAg-specific cellular responsiveness. Antibody responses, in all likelihood, reflected the intensity and state of infection, and not the degree of acquired immunity protective against parasite aggregation.
onchocerciasis	IL-5	Positive	PMID:8099937	Steel C, Nutman TB: Regulation of IL-5 in onchocerciasis. J Immunol. 1993 Jun 15;150(12):5511-8. A critical role for IL-2. . The cytokine profiles of PBMC obtained from individuals "immune" to Onchocerca volvulus infection were compared to those from infected individuals. The immune individuals had significantly higher levels of both IL-2 and IL-5 in response to parasite Ag than did those individuals with active infection (mean IL-2 = 1.3 and 0.138 U/ml, respectively; mean IL-5 = 973 and 147.4 pg/ml, respectively), and there was a direct correlation between the production of IL-2 and IL-5. To examine the mechanism underlying the possible association between these two cytokines in patients infected with onchocerciasis, reverse transcription followed by polymerase chain reaction was used to measure IL-5 mRNA. In response to rIL-2, IL-5 mRNA appeared as early as early as 3 h after stimulation of patient PBMC, reaching a peak at 24 h; further, this response was inhibited with neutralizing antibodies to IL-2. IL-2 was unable to induce mRNA expression for IL-4, IFN-gamma, IL-10, or granulocyte-macrophage-CSF. To assess whether IL-2 was specifically responsible for the up-regulation of Ag-induced IL-5 production in patients with onchocerciasis, IL-5 mRNA expression was measured in PBMC stimulated with parasite Ag. Up-regulation of IL-5 mRNA was seen in all patients (peaking at 72 h) in response to Ag stimulation and was found to be independent of proliferation to Ag; in addition, this up-regulation was specifically inhibited by neutralizing anti-IL-2 antibodies. Further, the primary source of IL-5 mRNA was determined to be CD4+ T cells. These findings suggest that IL-2 production is required to induce IL-5 and further implicates IL-5 as a possible mediator of protection in onchocerciasis.
onchocerciasis	IL-5	Positive	PMID:1918387	Limaye AP, Abrams JS, Silver JE, Awadzi K, Francis HF, Ottesen EA, Nutman TB: Interleukin-5 and the posttreatment eosinophilia in patients with onchocerciasis. J Clin Invest. 1991 Oct;88(4):1418-21. To understand the role of the eosinophilopoietic cytokine IL-5 in humans, the posttreatment eosinophilic response in a group of microfilaria (mf)-positive patients with onchocerciasis (n = 10) was examined before and after treatment with diethylcarbamazine (6 mg/kg for 7 d). Sequential blood samples were assessed at 24 and 1 h before treatment (baseline values), then at frequent intervals over the next 14 d. Symptom scores, skin microfilariae (mf), and peripheral blood eosinophil counts were recorded as a function of time after treatment, and serum levels of IL-5 were quantitated by a highly sensitive (sensitivity greater than or equal to 20 pg/ml) monoclonal-based ELISA. Pretreatment eosinophil counts ranged from 240 to 1,186 eosinophils/microliter (geometric mean, 675), and the mf counts from 10 to 218 per mg skin (geometric mean, 79). After an initial decline in the peripheral eosinophil count to 28 +/- 8% of pretreatment levels at 8 h after beginning treatment, the eosinophil counts steadily increased over the next 2 wk, reaching a maximum at 14 d (257 +/- 38% of pretreatment levels). Serum levels of IL-5 rose sharply from pretreatment levels to a peak of 70.5 +/- 11 pg/ml by 24 h after treatment. Serum IL-5 remained elevated over the next 2-3 d and declined toward baseline by approximately 6 d after treatment, at which time the eosinophil levels were steadily increasing. IL-3 and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor, two other cytokines implicated in eosinophilopoeisis, were not detectable in the serum at any time before or after treatment. The rise in serum IL-5 before the posttreatment eosinophilia seen in this group of patients with onchocerciasis demonstrates a temporal relationship between IL-5 and the subsequent development of eosinophilia and implicates IL-5 as an important mediator of eosinophilia in humans.
onchocerciasis	IRBP	Positive	PMID:2378211	Van der Lelij A, Rothova A, Stilma JS, Vetter JC, Hoekzema R, Kijlstra A: Humoral and cell-mediated immune response against human retinal antigens in relation to ocular onchocerciasis. Acta Leiden. 1990;59(1-2):271-83. Autoimmune mechanisms are thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of the chorioretinal changes in ocular onchocerciasis. The humoral autoimmune response was determined by measuring serum levels of autoantibodies, directed against human S-antigen and interphotoreceptor retinoid binding protein (IRBP) using an enzyme immunoassay. The cell-mediated immune response to these antigens and a crude retinal extract was investigated by means of a two-step migration inhibition factor assay. Patients with onchocerciasis (n = 50) were subdivided into three groups: 1. without ocular involvement (n = 10), 2. with ocular onchocerciasis limited to the anterior segment (n = 19), 3. with onchocercal chorioretinopathy (n = 21). A group of endemic controls from Sierra Leone, West Africa were also studied. The cellular immune response to Concanavalin A was measured to assess the general capacity of lymphocytes to respond to a mitogen. High levels of anti-human S-antigen and IRBP antibodies were detected in patients with onchocerciasis and endemic controls. The levels of both anti-human S-antigen and IRBP antibodies were significantly higher in onchocerciasis patients compared to endemic controls (Mann-Whitney ranksum test; p less than 0.001 respectively 0.002). No relationship could be demonstrated between the anti-retinal antibody level and the occurrence of chorioretinitis in ocular onchocerciasis. The occurrence of the anti-retinal antibodies as a result of crossreactivity of anti-retinal antibodies with parasitic antigens or of induction of polyclonal B-cell activation due to parasitic infection is discussed, since high antibody levels were also found in patients with Bancroftian filariasis from Papua New Guinea and Surinam. The migration inhibition factor assay, in which the cell-mediated immune response to human S-antigen, IRBP and retinal extract was tested, showed that four out of 50 (8%) patients with onchocerciasis and four out of 25 (16%) endemic controls reacted with at least one retinal antigen. From the patients with onchocercal chorioretinopathy two out of 21 (10%) showed a positive cellular response. The general mitogen response tested with Con A was positive in all these individuals. In conclusion, circulating antibodies against human S-antigen or human IRBP are thus nor specific for onchocerciasis and in themselves not sufficient to cause chorioretinopathy in onchocerciasis, although their pathogenic role in an ongoing chorioretinitis cannot be excluded. Furthermore a role for a cell-mediated anti-retinal autoimmune mechanism in the pathogenesis of chorioretinitis in onchocerciasis as studied with human S-antigen, IRBP or crude retinal extract could not be demonstrated.

Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci. 1990 Jul;31(7):1374-80. Autoimmune mechanisms are thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of the chorioretinal changes in ocular onchocerciasis. In this study, the involvement of autoimmunity against retinal antigens in developing chorioretinitis was investigated. Serum levels of autoantibodies, directed against human S-antigen and interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP), were determined in patients with onchocerciasis (n = 46) and endemic controls (n = 38) from Sierra Leone with the use of an enzyme immunoassay. In both groups high levels of anti-human S-antigen and IRBP antibodies were detected. No relationship could be demonstrated between the antiretinal antibody level and the occurrence of chorioretinitis in onchocerciasis. The levels of both anti-human S-antigen and IRBP antibodies were significantly higher in patients with onchocerciasis compared with endemic controls (P less than 0.001). Cross-reactivity of antiretinal antibodies with parasitic antigens could not be demonstrated as a possible explanation for the higher levels in patients with onchocerciasis. No correlation was found between the levels of antibodies of different classes against the crude Onchocerca volvulus, the egg antigen, or the microfilariae and the antiretinal antibody levels. Furthermore, in a panel of 13 different monoclonal antibodies directed against O. volvulus, only one showed a slight anti-human IRBP reactivity and none reacted with S-antigen. The immune response against the two retinal antigens investigated was not specific for onchocerciasis because high antibody levels were also found in patients with Bancroftian filariasis from Papua, New Guinea, and Surinam.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
onchocerciasis	immunoglobulin	Positive	PMID:15642982	Gomez-Priego A, Mendoza R, de-la-Rosa JL: Prevalence of antibodies to onchocerca volvulus in residents of Oaxaca, Mexico, treated for 10 years with ivermectin. Clin Diagn Lab Immunol. 2005 Jan;12(1):40-3. Studies to determine the prevalence of antibodies to Onchocerca volvulus, prior to and after actions carried out to interrupt transmission, are scarce in Mexico. Here we report the prevalence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgG4 antibodies in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) against a crude extract of O. volvulus adult worm in serum samples from persons under noninterrupted biannual treatment with ivermectin in areas of onchocercosis endemicity in Mexico. To perform the prevalence studies, the ELISA procedures were first evaluated. Serological studies were performed with serum samples from skin microfilaria carriers from Guatemala and from people microfilariodermic negative living in the same area as the Guatemalan patients. Sensitivity values for IgG or IgG4 detection were 71 and 86%, while specificities were 92 and 100%, respectively. No anti-O. volvulus antibodies were found in samples from nonendemic controls from Mexico, but 3 of 71 samples from residents in the onchocercosis area of Oaxaca, Mexico, and who have been under ivermectin treatment during the last 10 years were only positive to IgG. Notwithstanding that the IgG4 isotype was not detected and a low (4.2%) anti-O. volvulus IgG antibody prevalence was found, a seroepidemiological follow-up must be performed in order to confirm interruption of onchocercosis transmission in the area of Oaxaca, Mexico, in which onchocercosis is endemic.

Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg. 1997 Mar-Apr;91(2):226-30. The excretory-secretory (E-S) products of helminths are considered to comprise immunogenic molecules of high diagnostic value. In the present study, the serodiagnostic potential of the E-S products released in vitro by cultured female Onchocerca volvulus was investigated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blotting using 190 serum samples from persons infected with O. volvulus and unexposed persons. The sensitivity of detection of anti-O. volvulus E-S antibodies was 94% for sera from patients with the generalized form of onchocerciasis and 100% for sera from patients with the chronic hyperreactive form (sowda). 95% of the sera from amicrofilaridermic persons, who subsequently became microfilaridermic within 2 years, reacted with O. volvulus E-S antigens and the donors were therefore regarded as having had a prepatent infection when first examined. These sera gave higher (P antibody reactivity after emergence of microfilariae. The specificity of the E-S ELISA was 100% when sera of subjects infected with Wuchereria bancrofti were used, and at least 88% for Mansonella perstans sera. In Western blot analysis, the sera of persons with generalized onchocerciasis recognized 7 protein bands. Many E-S proteins were stained less intensely by the sera of subjects with generalized onchocerciasis than by the sera of sowda patients. Similar antigen bands were demonstrated using sera from the persons with prepatent infections.

Clin Diagn Lab Immunol. 1996 Jan;3(1):98-104. To characterize the patterns of immunoglobulin G (IgG) subclass and IgE reactivity during the early stages of onchocerciasis, sera were collected from 224 children (age groups, 2 to 5, 6 to 10, and 11 to 15 years) residing in a region of Sierra Leone where Onchocerca volvulus is endemic, and these samples were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for their reactivity to adult antigens (OvAg) and against four recombinant proteins (OV11, OV27, OV29, and OV16). Over 88% of the samples contained detectable levels of anti-OvAg IgG. In samples from microfilaria (MF)-positive children, IgG4 responses were significantly elevated and constituted on average 39, 35 and 28% of the total IgG responses for the age groups of 2 to 5, 6 to 10, and 11 to 15 years, respectively. For MF-negative individuals, the mean contributions of IgG4 to the total IgG response were 11% (2 to 5 years), 27% (6 to 10 years), and 56% (11 to 15 years). OvAg-specific IgE was detectable in the sera from both MF-negative and MF-positive individuals. To increase the specificity of the response, recombinant antigens OV11, OV27, and OV29 were tested individually or as a cocktail. Nearly 50% of the MF-negative children and 85% of the MF-positive children had detectable levels of IgG against at least one of the recombinant antigens. Only a small portion of the IgG against the recombinant peptides was IgG4. The prevalence of IgG against OV16 in samples from MF-negative children was 51%, and that for MF-positive children was 75%. The general profile of the humoral immune responses mounted by both MF-positive and a large percentage of the MF-negative children during the initial phases of infection with O. volvulus is similar to the profile reported for adults harboring chronic O. volvulus infections. These results suggest that very quickly after infection, the interactions between parasite and host result in an immunological environment that may contribute to the maintenance of a long-term, chronic infection.

J Clin Microbiol. 1993 Jul;31(7):1741-5. Serodiagnostic assays for onchocerciasis based on native antigens are hampered by the scarcity of antigen, and they suffer from poor specificity. The present study was designed to evaluate the diagnostic utility of recently described recombinant Onchocerca volvulus antigens OC 3.6 and OC 9.3 in enzyme immunoassays. The recombinant proteins were expressed as glutathione S-transferase fusions and were tested in several enzyme immunoassay formats to measure immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgG4 antibodies with sera from patients with onchocerciasis in Nigeria and with various types of control sera. The best results were obtained by measuring IgG4 antibodies to the fusion proteins. Forty of 42 (95%) serum specimens from patients with onchocerciasis were reactive with OC 3.6; the reactivity with OC 9.3 was 81%. Results obtained with sera from experimentally infected chimpanzees suggest that OC 3.6 might be especially useful for detecting prepatent infections in humans, while OC 9.3 mainly detects mature, patent infections. Sera from individuals in Nigeria and the United States residing in areas nonendemic for onchocerciasis were uniformly nonreactive with these antigens in IgG and IgG4 assays, as were sera from patients with bancroftian filariasis, brugian filariasis, loiasis, ascariasis, schistomiasis, and dracunculiasis. These results suggest that enzyme immunoassays based on the recombinant antigens OC 3.6 and OC 9.3 are useful for the diagnosis of onchocerciasis.
onchocerciasis	immunoglobulin	Positive	PMID:3324466	Parkhouse RM, Almond NM, Cabrera Z, Harnett W: Nematode antigens in protection, diagnosis and pathology. Vet Immunol Immunopathol. 1987 Dec;17(1-4):313-24. A thorough study of parasite antigens is a prerequisite for control programmes based on protection by vaccination, accurate serodiagnosis and perhaps immune modulation to diminish pathological sequelae. Stage specific surface secreted and somatic antigens may be of particular value in proceeding towards these goals. The design of vaccines is most appropriately focused on surface antigens. With respect to pathology, certain antigens must stimulate humoral and, or cellular immune responses which are responsible for the undesirable immunopathologic consequences of the disease. The ultimate objective, therefore, is identification of those particular antigens followed by appropriate down regulation of the immune system in order to delete such potentially harmful immunological reactions. The relevant illustration presented in this context is an interesting correlation between one particular clinical condition of onchocerciasis ("sowda") and the serological response, defined both in terms of the parasite antigen and an immunoglobulin class restricted antibody response. Current parasitological methods of diagnosis consistently underestimate parasite prevalence. Failure to detect low level patent infections incurs the risk of having a reservoir capable of perpetuating infections. There is, then, an urgent requirement for accurate serodiagnosis, to be used in association with, and for the evaluation of, drug treatment and vector elimination in parasite control programmes. Given the high sensitivity of current immunoassay technology, the only bar to establishing the necessary immunological tests is the choice of suitably specific antibody-antigen systems. Once these are identified, a combination of recombinant nucleic acid biochemistry and hybridoma technology should provide the necessary reagents for inexpensive, robust and specific diagnostic tests. In addition, it may not be many years before the ubiquitous RIA and ELISA technology gives way to the newly developing biosensor systems. Finally, given the sensitivity and specificity of today's nucleic acid hybridization techniques, we may soon expect to see specific identification of infective larvae in their vectors of this, a cloned DNA probe specific for Onchocerca volvulus, and with potential for the detection of infective larvae in blackflies is described.
onchocerciasis	immunoglobulin	Positive	PMID:3224441	Cabrera Z, Buttner DW, Parkhouse RM: Unique recognition of a low molecular weight Onchocerca volvulus antigen by IgG3 antibodies in chronic hyper-reactive oncho-dermatitis (Sowda). Clin Exp Immunol. 1988 Nov;74(2):223-9. Individual human Ig class responses to Onchocerca volvulus antigens have been evaluated by Western blotting using sera from cases of generalized onchocerciasis and chronic hyper-reactive onchocerciasis (Sowda). in all cases except IgG3 the patterns of recognition by human antibody classes were similar in Sowda and generalized onchocerciasis. Weak or undetectable responses were seen with IgG1, IgG2 and IgM. The total profiles of antigens recognized by the other Ig classes were different, although in some cases certain bands were commonly identified. The result with IgG3, however, was striking. Here, two major antigens (9 kD and 72kD) were recognized by IgG3 antibodies in Sowda sera but not generalized onchocerciasis sera. Furthermore, these two antigens were not recognised by any other Ig class, either in generalized or Sowda onchocerciasis, nor were they detected by antibodies of any class present in a collection of sera representative of other nematode infections. This difference in the IgG3 response was so pronounced that Sowda sera could be distinguished from generalized onchocerciasis sera by an IgG3-specific ELISA assay with a PBS parasite extract as the antigen. Thus, a correlation has been established between one particular clinical condition of onchocerciasis (Sowda) and a serological response, defined in terms of both the parasite antigens and an immunoglobulin class restricted antibody response.
onchocerciasis	immunoglobulin	Positive	PMID:2682485	Parkhouse RM, Harrison LJ: Antigens of parasitic helminths in diagnosis, protection and pathology. Parasitology. 1989;99 Suppl:S5-19. A thorough study of parasitic helminth antigens is a pre-requisite for control programmes based on accurate immunochemical diagnosis, protection by vaccination and perhaps immune modulation to diminish pathological sequelae. Studies should be directed at the identification of those stage- or age-specific surface, secreted and somatic antigens which are involved in the host-parasite interactions responsible for immunity and/or pathology. Current methods of diagnosis of parasitic infections often fail to detect low-level patent infections, which incurs the risk of having a reservoir capable of perpetuating infections. There is, then, an urgent requirement for accurate immunochemical diagnosis, to be used in association with, and for the evaluation of, drug treatment and vector elimination, in parasite control programmes. Given the high sensitivity of current immunoassay technology, the only bar to establishing the necessary immunological tests is the choice of suitably specific antigen/antibody systems. Assays designed to detect parasite products or antigens are a major priority, as they indicate current infection, whereas those which detect antibody only indicate exposure to infection, which may or may not be current. Surface and secreted antigens are the most likely targets for protective immune responses and thus form a logical focus for vaccine design. The cestodes, which present such strong evidence for immunity following natural infection, are likely to yield effective vaccines by modern procedures. Certain antigens must, however, stimulate the humoral and/or cellular responses which are responsible for the undesirable immunopathological consequences of many helminthic diseases. The nematodes and trematodes furnish some extreme examples of such pathology. The ultimate objective in identifying these particular antigens is to utilize them in the appropriate down-regulation of the immune response responsible for such pathology. As an illustration, we have presented an interesting correlation between one particular clinical condition of onchocerciasis (Sowda) and the serological response, defined both in terms of the parasite antigens and an immunoglobulin class-restricted antibody response. Finally, the complexity of these parasite systems and the host response to the parasite should not be underestimated. Modern analytical techniques allow their detailed analysis in terms of the humoral antibody responses and afford the possibility of the future development of control and disease management procedures tailored to each individual host-parasite system. However, novel systems are required to complete the analysis of the cellular components of the immune response to parasite antigens, and functional studies are needed to determine the role that these parasite antigens play in the complex interaction between parasite and host.
onchocerciasis	MCP-3	Negative	PMID:10794432	Cooper PJ, Beck LA, Espinel I, Deyampert NM, Hartnell A, Jose PJ, Paredes W, Guderian RH, Nutman TB: Eotaxin and RANTES expression by the dermal endothelium is associated with eosinophil infiltration after ivermectin treatment of onchocerciasis. Clin Immunol. 2000 Apr;95(1 Pt 1):51-61. The roles of eotaxin, RANTES, and MCP-3 expression in eosinophil recruitment to the site of parasite killing that occurs following ivermectin treatment of onchocerciasis were assessed in the skin of 13 Onchocerca volvulus-infected subjects and two noninfected controls before and after ivermectin treatment. Adverse reactions in infected subjects were associated with the appearance of eosinophils in the dermis as part of a perivascular inflammatory infiltrate. Although no expression of RANTES and eotaxin was seen in dermal vascular endothelial cells in biopsies taken before treatment (nor at any time in the skin of uninfected controls), endothelial expression of both eotaxin and RANTES was noted by 24 h following treatment. While RANTES expression was transient, eotaxin expression increased in parallel with increasing eosinophil recruitment up to 60 h posttreatment. These observations indicate that endothelial expression of eotaxin and RANTES may have an important role in eosinophil recruitment into the skin during helminth-killing reactions.
onchocerciasis	myosin	Negative	PMID:8719949	Zhang D, Miller DJ: Characterization of a novel non-muscle myosin-related protein from Onchocerca gibsoni. Int J Parasitol. 1995 Dec;25(12):1385-91. A cDNA library was constructed in lambda gt11 using poly (A)+ mRNA from early larvae of Onchocerca gibsoni. Screening of the library using serum from a single onchocerciasis patient yielded several strongly immunoreactive clones, one of which (OGK2) was found to encode a novel myosin-related protein. cDNA clone OGK2 contained an insert of 2017 bp, consisting of continuous open reading frame in frame with the vector, hence this clone encodes 671 amino acid residues of a larger protein. A fragment (619 nt) of the OGK2 cDNA was subcloned into the expression vector pGEX-1N to generate a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein. Polyclonal antiserum raised to this fusion protein strongly recognised an O. gibsoni protein of approximately 220 kDa. Immunolocalization studies indicated that this protein was associated predominantly with the hypodermis and a number of other specific membrane layers in the adult parasite. Myosin-related proteins are frequently immunodominant parasite antigens and in a number of studies have been shown to confer a degree of protective immunity against the corresponding parasite. Evaluation of the protective potential of the OGK2 protein, therefore, appears to be warranted.
onchocerciasis	TNF-alpha	Positive	PMID:15210803	Brattig NW, Bazzocchi C, Kirschning CJ, Reiling N, Buttner DW, Ceciliani F, Geisinger F, Hochrein H, Ernst M, Wagner H, Bandi C, Hoerauf A: The major surface protein of Wolbachia endosymbionts in filarial nematodes elicits immune responses through TLR2 and TLR4. J Immunol. 2004 Jul 1;173(1):437-45. More than 150 million humans in tropical countries are infected by filarial nematodes which harbor intracellular bacterial endosymbionts of the genus Wolbachia (Rickettsiales). These bacteria have been implicated in adverse effects of drug treatment in filariasis. The present study provides evidence that purified major Wolbachia surface protein (rWSP) acts as an inducer of the innate immune system through TLR2 and TLR4: 1) recombinant, stringently purified rWSP elicited the release of TNF-alpha, IL-12, and IL-8 from cultured blood cells of both Onchocerca volvulus-infected and uninfected people; 2) the inflammatory response to rWSP challenge was TLR2- and TLR4-dependent as demonstrated with TLR-transfected fibroblastoid cells, as well as macrophages and dendritic cells from functional TLR-deficient mice; 3) blood cells of onchocerciasis patients exposed to rWSP also generated down-regulating mediators IL-10 and PGE (2) after 6 days of culture; 4) furthermore, rWSP-reactive IgG1 Abs were present in sera of O. volvulus-infected people but not in those of uninfected Europeans. The lack of rWSP-reactive IgE and IgG4 in serum indicated a bias toward a Th1-type adaptive immune response. Abs against rWSP stained endobacteria in living and degenerating adult O. volvulus filariae, tissue microfilariae and host tissue macrophages that apparently had engulfed microfilariae. Thus, filarial helminths, through products of their endobacteria such as WSP, acquire characteristics of a typical microbial pathogen inducing immune responses via TLR2 and TLR4.
onchocerciasis	TNF-alpha	Positive	PMID:9226684	Winkler S, Paiha S, Winkler H, Graninger W, Marberger M, Steiner GE: Microfilarial clearance in loiasis involves elevation of Th1 and Th2 products and emergence of a specific pattern of T-cell populations. Parasite Immunol. 1996 Sep;18(9):479-82. Diethylcarbamazine (DEC) induced clearance of microfilaraemia in loiasis is associated with severe posttreatment reactions. To define the switch from hypo- to hyper-responsiveness associated with DEC treatment, phenotypic alterations of T-lymphocytes, characterized by flow cytometry, and cytokines, determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, were monitored in a microfilaraemic patient. In contrast to reports on onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariases, no elevation of interleukin (IL)-6 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha was observed. The most severe side effects coincided with an elevation of interferon (IFN)-gamma on day 3, followed by IL-10, transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta 2 and macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha (MIP-1 alpha) peaking on day 5. Phenotypically, T-cell activation markers CD38, CD54 and CD25 were significantly expressed before treatment, with high CD38 expression still existing one year after clearance of microfilaraemia. Treatment-related increases were observed with anti-CD122, anti-HLA-DR and anti-CD69. CD28 was expressed before treatment on almost 100% of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and dropped to 20% by day 5, reaching again baseline levels on day 21. Furthermore, there emerged 20% TCR alpha beta+/CD3+ T cells and 10% anti-beta V5 (c)+ T cells, altogether indicating a specific pattern of T-helper (Th) 1 and Th2 cytokines as well as expansion of certain pauciclonal T-cell populations in response to microfilarial clearance.
onchocerciasis	TNF-alpha	Positive	PMID:8077726	Njoo FL, Hack CE, Oosting J, Luyendijk L, Stilma JS, Kijlstra A: C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 are elevated in onchocerciasis patients after ivermectin treatment. J Infect Dis. 1994 Sep;170(3):663-8. Ivermectin treatment of onchocerciasis can induce adverse reactions. Mechanisms underlying these reactions are poorly understood but may include activation of neutrophils. This study investigated the acute-phase response in onchocerciasis patients during 2 days after ivermectin treatment. The acute-phase protein C-reactive protein (CRP) and cytokines that mediate the acute-phase response (tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF alpha] and interleukin-6 [IL-6]) were measured in 144 skin snip-positive onchocerciasis patients and 12 skin snip-negative controls who received one dose of ivermectin (150 micrograms/kg). No elevated TNF alpha levels were found, but IL-6 and CRP were elevated in 25.7% and 50.7% of the patients, respectively, after ivermectin treatment. Most patients (89.2%) with raised IL-6 also had raised CRP. Such increases were not observed in controls and in patients were correlated with adverse reactions and microfilarial densities. These findings suggest a possible role of the acute-phase response in microfilarial destruction following ivermectin treatment.
onchocerciasis	RANTES	Positive	PMID:16232219	Fendt J, Hamm DM, Banla M, Schulz-Key H, Wolf H, Helling-Giese G, Heuschkel C, Soboslay PT: Chemokines in onchocerciasis patients after a single dose of ivermectin. . Clin Exp Immunol. 2005 Nov;142(2):318-26. Ivermectin treatment will effectively diminish microfilariae (Mf) of Onchocerca volvulus in the skin of patients, but therapy is associated with adverse host inflammatory responses. To investigate the association of proinflammatory chemokines with the intensity of infection and clinical adverse reactions, chemokine serum levels were measured in patients following ivermectin treatment (100 microg/kg, 150 microg/kg or 200 microg/kg) or placebo. The density of O. volvulus Mf per mg skin decreased by 85%, 97%, 97% and 90% at day 3, at month 3, month 6 and at 1 year post-ivermectin. The cutaneous T cell-attracting chemokine (CTACK/CCL27) was found highly elevated in onchocerciasis patients compared to infection-free European controls (P = 0.0004) and it did not change following ivermectin or placebo to 1 year post-therapy. The chemokine RANTES/CCL5 (regulated on activated and normally T cell-expressed) was similarly high in onchocerciasis patients and infection-free European controls; the RANTES/CCL5 levels did not change following treatment until 6 months post-therapy but were slightly elevated at 1 year post-therapy (P thymus and activation regulated chemokine (TARC/CCL17) and macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC/CCL22), were activated at 3 days post-ivermectin (P protein (MIP)-1alpha/CCL3 and MIP-1beta/CCL4 were low before ivermectin treatment, but following clearance of microfilariae of O. volvulus their levels increased from 6 months post-therapy onwards (for both at 12 months post-therapy, P ivermectin or with the serum levels of MIP-1alpha/CCL3, MIP-1beta/CCL4, TARC/CCL17, MDC/CCL22 and CTACK/CCL27. Our observations suggest that following ivermectin, macrophages as well as memory Th2-type lymphocytes and B cells, attracted and activated by MDC/CCL22, TARC/CCL17 and CTACK/CCL27, may contribute to dermal immune responses and O. volvulus Mf killing and clearance. The transient changes of TARC/CCL17 and MDC/CCL22 were not associated with clinical adverse responses, and the later rise of MIP-1alpha/CCL3 and MIP-1beta/CCL4 showed a reactivation of Type 1 immune responses associated with persistent low levels of O. volvulus microfilariae and an expiring O. volvulus infection.
onchocerciasis	RANTES	Positive	PMID:10794432	Cooper PJ, Beck LA, Espinel I, Deyampert NM, Hartnell A, Jose PJ, Paredes W, Guderian RH, Nutman TB: Eotaxin and RANTES expression by the dermal endothelium is associated with eosinophil infiltration after ivermectin treatment of onchocerciasis.

The roles of eotaxin, RANTES, and MCP-3 expression in eosinophil recruitment to the site of parasite killing that occurs following ivermectin treatment of onchocerciasis were assessed in the skin of 13 Onchocerca volvulus-infected subjects and two noninfected controls before and after ivermectin treatment. Adverse reactions in infected subjects were associated with the appearance of eosinophils in the dermis as part of a perivascular inflammatory infiltrate. Although no expression of RANTES and eotaxin was seen in dermal vascular endothelial cells in biopsies taken before treatment (nor at any time in the skin of uninfected controls), endothelial expression of both eotaxin and RANTES was noted by 24 h following treatment. While RANTES expression was transient, eotaxin expression increased in parallel with increasing eosinophil recruitment up to 60 h posttreatment. These observations indicate that endothelial expression of eotaxin and RANTES may have an important role in eosinophil recruitment into the skin during helminth-killing reactions.
onchocerciasis	PDGFRA	Negative	PMID:16931288	Schwartz LB: Diagnostic value of tryptase in anaphylaxis and mastocytosis. Immunol Allergy Clin North Am. 2006 Aug;26(3):451-63. Serum (or plasma) levels of total and mature tryptase measurements are recommended in the diagnostic evaluation of systemic anaphylaxis and systemic mastocytosis, but their interpretation must be considered in the context of a complete workup of each patient. Total tryptase levels generally reflect the increased burden of mast cells in patients with all forms of systemic mastocytosis (indolent systemic mastocytosis, smoldering systemic mastocytosis, systemic mastocytosis associated with a hematologic clonal non-mast cell disorder, aggressive systemic mastocytosis, and mast cell leukemia) and the decreased burden of mast cells associated with cytoreductive therapies in these disorders. Causes of an elevated total tryptase level other than systemic mastocytosis must be considered, however, and include systemic anaphylaxis, acute myelocytic leukemia, various myelodysplastic syndromes, hypereosinophilic syndrome associated with the FLP1L1-PDGFRA mutation, end-stage renal failure, and treatment of onchocerciasis. Mature (beta) tryptase levels generally reflect the magnitude of mast cell activation and are elevated during most cases of systemic anaphylaxis, particularly with parenteral exposure to the inciting agent.
onchocerciasis	NADH-dehydrogenase-subunit-4	Positive	PMID:16892627	Rodriguez-Perez MA, Nunez-Gonzalez CA, Lizarazo-Ortega C, Sanchez-Varela A, Wooten MC, Unnasch TR: Analysis of genetic variation in ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer and the NADH dehydrogenase subunit 4 mitochondrial genes of the onchocerciasis vector Simulium ochraceum. J Med Entomol. 2006 Jul;43(4):701-6. Onchocerciasis is a serious disease vectored by black flies in the genus Simulium that are infected with the filarial parasite Onchocerca volvulus. In the Americas, black flies of the Simulium ochraceum s.l. species complex are important vectors of this parasite. Cytological studies have suggested that this species complex consists of at least three cytotypes that inhabit distinct habitats. In this study, the NADH dehydrogenase subunit four (ND4) and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) of the ribosomal RNA gene cluster were used to explore the degree of genetic diversity among S. ochraceum s.l. populations found in the three O. volvulus foci in Mexico. Both sequence regions were found to exhibit intra- and interpopulation variation. Four different ND4 alleles were found among the populations examined. Similarly, variation was noted in the ITS domain sequences within and among populations. Variation within the ITS sequence was primarily confined to a complex microsatellite locus. Four ITS length variants were observed, two of which were only seen in flies collected from the onchocerciasis focus in northern Chiapas. These data suggest that the ND4 and ITS sequences may prove to be useful markers for exploring interactions within and among the S. ochraceum s.l. populations in Mexico.
onchocerciasis	lactoferrin	Negative	PMID:8222324	Njoo FL, Hack CE, Oosting J, Stilma JS, Kijlstra A: Neutrophil activation in ivermectin-treated onchocerciasis patients. Clin Exp Immunol. 1993 Nov;94(2):330-3. Ivermectin is a safe and effective drug for onchocerciasis treatment. In certain individuals, however, therapy is accompanied by adverse reactions. The mechanisms underlying these reactions are not yet known. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether neutrophils are involved in the development of these adverse reactions. Elastase and lactoferrin, two markers for the release of neutrophil azurophilic and specific granule contents respectively, were measured by radioimmunoassays in plasma of onchocerciasis patients with varying degrees of side effects, as well as in control subjects before and 1 and 2 days after ivermectin treatment. A considerable increase of elastase levels after treatment was observed, whereas lactoferrin levels did not change. The percentage of patients with elevated elastase levels was significantly correlated with the degree of side effects. These findings suggest that neutrophil activation may be involved in the development of adverse reactions in these patients.
onchocerciasis	eosinophil-cationic-protein	Positive	PMID:10206116	Tischendorf FW, Brattig NW, Burchard GD, Kubica T, Kreuzpaintner G, Lintzel M: Eosinophils, eosinophil cationic protein and eosinophil-derived neurotoxin in serum and urine of patients with onchocerciasis coinfected with intestinal nematodes and in urinary schistosomiasis. Acta Trop. 1999 Mar 15;72(2):157-73. Eosinophils, eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN/EPX), myeloperoxidase (MPO) and IgE were measured in blood, serum and/or urine in Schistosoma haematobium- and Onchocerca volvulus-infected Guineans and O. volvulus- and S. haematobium-negative Guineans coinfected or infected with intestinal nematodes. The number of eosinophils and levels of eosinophil granule proteins but not of MPO were found to be strongly elevated in all Africans as compared to European controls. The highest serum ECP and serum and urinary EDN/EPX levels were observed in the hyperreactive form of onchocerciasis (sowda). Onchocerciasis patients and O. volvulus-negative Africans coinfected or infected with intestinal nematodes (hookworm and/or Ascaris lumbricoides) revealed higher serum granule protein concentrations and/or absolute eosinophil counts and urinary ECP than those without nematode infections. Statistical differences between both sections were found for the absolute eosinophil counts and for serum EDN/EPX and IgE in generalized onchocerciasis, and for urinary ECP in sowda, indicating stimulation of the eosinophil potential of O. volvulus-positive patients by coexistent hookworm infection. This worm species, in contrast to A. lumbricoides, causes especially high eosinophil counts and EDN/EPX and IgE levels. From these results it is concluded that in nematode diseases, ECP and EDN/EPX levels reflect the degree of antigenic stimulation, eosinophil activation and eosinophil turnover rates. Serum ECP and serum and urinary EDN/EPX may, therefore, serve as parameters to monitor helminth infection. Urinary ECP may be a marker of eosinophiluria secondary to urogenital manifestation of S. haematobium. It is elevated in hyperreactive onchocerciasis activated by intestinal nematodes.
onchocerciasis	glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase	Negative	PMID:15955451	Erttmann KD, Kleensang A, Schneider E, Hammerschmidt S, Buttner DW, Gallin M: Cloning, characterization and DNA immunization of an Onchocerca volvulus glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Ov-GAPDH). Biochim Biophys Acta. 2005 Jun 30;1741(1-2):85-94. Epub 2005 Jan 5. In the search for Onchocerca volvulus antigens possibly involved in protection against human onchocerciasis, partial amino acid sequence analysis of one of the O. volvulus antigens of the serologically identified proteins showed a close relationship to the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) protein family. Subsequent adult worm cDNA library screening and cloning produced a clone of 1650 bp. An open reading frame spans over 1020 bp encoding for a protein of 340 amino acids with an apparent molecular weight of 38000. Comparison of the complete amino acid sequence identified this protein as a member of the GAPDH protein family. The recombinantly expressed protein shows GAPDH enzymatic activity as well as plasminogen-binding capacity. DNA sequence analysis of the corresponding gene revealed the presence of two introns. Using immunohistology Ov-GAPDH was observed in microfilariae, infective larvae, and adult male and female worms. Most striking was the labelling of the musculature of the body wall. Labelling was also observed in the pseudocoeloma cavity and in a subset of cell nuclei, suggesting additional, non-glycolytic functions of the Ov-GAPDH. Gene gun immunization with the DNA-construct in cattle led to specific humoral immune responses. Thus, the protective potential of the DNA-construct of Ov-GAPDH can be evaluated in vaccination trials using animal models such as the cattle/Onchocerca ochengi model.
onchocerciasis	calreticulin	Positive	PMID:10320638	Eggleton P, Llewellyn DH: Pathophysiological roles of calreticulin in autoimmune disease. Scand J Immunol. 1999 May;49(5):466-73. Autoantibodies against the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) luminal protein, calreticulin are often present in sera from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatic disease and various parasitic diseases including onchocerciasis. New information has revealed that calreticulin is implicated in a number of autoimmune processes, including molecular mimicry, epitope spreading, complement inactivation and stimulation of inflammatory mediators, such as nitric oxide production. Calreticulin also binds to the Ro/SS-A antigen complex, which is composed of at least three immunologically distinct proteins bound to a group of small cytoplasmic RNAs that together form a common target for autoimmune responses. Up-regulation of calreticulin at the protein and RNA levels can be triggered by cell stresses, including heat shock, exposure to heavy metals and perturbation of normal ER function, which may in some cases lead to its secretion from cells. Calreticulin is targeted by autoantibodies following its release into the extracellular environment, possibly as a result of cell death, or its presence at the cell surface in response to insults such as viral infection or ultraviolet irradiation. These findings suggest that calreticulin is not just an autoantigen, but plays an active role in the pathology of various autoimmune disease through determinant spreading.
onchocerciasis	calreticulin	Positive	PMID:7901281	Meilof JF, Van der Lelij A, Rokeach LA, Hoch SO, Smeenk RJ: Autoimmunity and filariasis. J Immunol. 1993 Nov 15;151(10):5800-9. Autoantibodies against cytoplasmic cellular proteins in sera of patients with onchocerciasis. Onchocerciasis or "river blindness" is a vector-borne tropical disease resulting from infection with the filarial nematode Onchocerca volvulus. Disease manifestations include dermatitis, rheumatic complaints, and blindness. Recent findings have suggested an autoimmune etiology for the occurrence of chorioretinopathy, a disease of the eye which together with sclerosing keratoconjunctivitis is responsible for approximately 400,000 onchocerciasis-related cases of blindness. The identification of onchocerciasis as an important cause of tropical rheumatism prompted us to evaluate serologically the presence of systemic autoimmune disease in onchocerciasis patients and local controls from a hyperendemic area in Sierra Leone. In both groups there was a marked autoimmune response against cytoplasmic non-RNA-associated proteins consisting of autoantibodies against five major Ag with respective m.w. of 35, 51, 64, 83, and 110 kDa. These five proteins are novel autoantigens that could be distinguished from calreticulin, the human homologue of the onchocercal Ag RAL-1, and known autoantigens such as the 50-kDa La/SS-B or 52- and 60-kDa Ro/SS-A proteins by immunoblotting and ELISA assays. Furthermore, autoantibody reactivity against calreticulin was significantly higher in O. volvulus-infected individuals than in endemic controls. Autoantibody reactivity against the five major autoantigens, anti-calreticulin reactivity, and antibody reactivity against the 65-kDa arthritis-associated mycobacterial heat shock protein were intercorrelated as parts of an onchocerciasis-associated autoimmune response. The implication of autoimmunity in the disease pathogenesis of onchocerciasis could have important consequences for future research on therapeutical regimens, pathogenetic mechanisms, and serological diagnosis of onchocerciasis.
onchocerciasis	calreticulin	Positive	PMID:7836063	Max H, Halder T, Kalbus M, Gnau V, Jung G, Kalbacher H: A 16mer peptide of the human autoantigen calreticulin is a most prominent HLA-DR4Dw4-associated self-peptide. Hum Immunol. 1994 Sep;41(1):39-45. The human Ca (2+)-binding (storage) protein calreticulin, located in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, is proposed to play a role as autoantigen: anticalreticulin autoantibodies occur in the sera of patients with SLE and patients with onchocerciasis (calreticulin shows a high sequence homology to the Onchocerca volvulus antigen RAL-1). Here we present sequencing data of a HLA-DR4Dw4-associated calreticulin peptide fragment, Cal (295-310), purified from a DR4Dw4 self-peptide pool. Cal (295-310) proved to be one of three commonest self-peptides associated with DR4Dw4 molecules that were isolated from the EBV-transformed B-cell line BSM (DR4Dw4, DRw53). We tested the binding of Cal (295-309) and the analogous RAL-1 peptide to HLA-DR molecules: Cal (295-309) exhibited specific binding characteristics for DR4Dw4. Binding assays using self-peptide analogues with replaced amino acids led us to a DR4Dw4-binding motif with anchor residues at relative positions 1 and 6. The sequencing data suggest that calreticulin is a frequently processed intracellular protein. The abundance of calreticulin makes the presentation of different calreticulin peptides associated with HLA-D molecules likely to occur, supporting the immunologic relevance of this molecule.
onchocerciasis	calreticulin	Positive	PMID:7680295	Routsias JG, Tzioufas AG, Sakarellos-Daitsiotis M, Sakarellos C, Moutsopoulos HM: Calreticulin synthetic peptide analogues: anti-peptide antibodies in autoimmune rheumatic diseases. Clin Exp Immunol. 1993 Mar;91(3):437-41. Autoantibodies in sera from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and onchocerciasis recognize calreticulin (CaR), a calcium-binding protein, as antigen. In this study we present the immunological properties of two synthetic peptides prepared to correspond to the 1-24 and 7-24 amino acid sequence of CaR. In contrast to information previously reported for the recombinant protein, the CaR-peptide analogues appeared immunoreactive to anti-Ro/SSA autoimmune sera. Human sera from patients with SLE, Sjogren's syndrome (SS), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), as well as mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD), demonstrated a positive autoimmune response (binding of antibodies), to the CaR-peptide analogues. These findings suggest that anti-calreticulin autoantibodies are not restricted to any disease specificity.
onchocerciasis	calreticulin	Positive	PMID:7520419	Rokeach LA, Zimmerman PA, Unnasch TR: Epitopes of the Onchocerca volvulus RAL1 antigen, a member of the calreticulin family of proteins, recognized by sera from patients with onchocerciasis. Infect Immun. 1994 Sep;62(9):3696-704. RAL1 is an antigen (Ag) encoded by the filarial nematode Onchocerca volvulus, the parasite causing onchocerciasis (river blindness). RAL1 shares 64.4% identity with the autoantigen calreticulin. The striking similarity of the parasite Ag and the human autoantigen has led to the hypothesis that RAL1 may induce a cross-reactive immune response to calreticulin, which in turn may be involved in the pathogenesis of onchocerciasis. To test this hypothesis, we explored the immune response to RAL1 recombinant Ag (RAL1 rAg) and human calreticulin in patients with O. volvulus infection. A total of 86% of the O. volvulus-infected individuals produced antibodies recognizing RAL1 rAg. Antibody reactivity to RAL1 rAg in patient sera was confined primarily to the central and carboxyl-terminal parts of the molecule. No significant correlations were found to associate recognition of RAL1 rAg, or any particular portion thereof, with a particular disease state. Antibodies against RAL1 thus appear to be produced as a general immune reaction to O. volvulus infection and do not necessarily lead to a cross-reacting response with the host protein. In contrast, 33% of the patient sera tested bound recombinant human calreticulin. All of these sera also recognized a polypeptide encompassing the carboxyl-terminal portion of the RAL1 rAg. These results suggest that recognition of an epitope encoded in the carboxyl-terminal portion of RAL1 is at least in part responsible for inducing a cross-reacting immune response to the host protein.
onchocerciasis	calreticulin	Positive	PMID:1602002	Lux FA, McCauliffe DP, Buttner DW, Lucius R, Capra JD, Sontheimer RD, Lieu TS: Serological cross-reactivity between a human Ro/SS-A autoantigen (calreticulin) and the lambda Ral-1 antigen of Onchocerca volvulus. J Clin Invest. 1992 Jun;89(6):1945-51. We have cloned and sequenced a 46-kD Ro/SS-A autoantigen gene that is the human homologue of the calcium-binding protein, calreticulin. The sequence of this 46-kD Ro/SS-A protein (calreticulin) has significant homology to lambda Ral-1, a recombinant cDNA clone corresponding to a major antigen of the nematode, Onchocerca volvulus, the infectious agent of onchocerciasis. We therefore sought to determine whether antibodies produced by onchocerciasis patients might crossreact with the human 46-kD Ro/SS-A autoantigen (calreticulin). 20 of 22 sera from Liberian onchocerciasis patients who had no known evidence of autoimmune disease were found to contain antibodies that reacted with the 46-kD Ro/SS-A (calreticulin) by immunoblot analysis. Characteristic of sera reactive with Ro/SS-A antigens, some onchocerciasis sera also immunoprecipitated the Ro/SS-A-associated hY RNAs. In addition, a monoclonal antibody raised against O. volvulus organisms reacted to purified human WiL-2 cell 46 kD Ro/SS-A antigen (calreticulin) by ELISA. These results strongly suggest that onchocerciasis patients produce antibodies that crossreact with the 46-kD human Ro/SS-A autoantigen (calreticulin) and raise the possibility that infectious organisms such as O. volvulus might play a triggering or exacerbating role in the human Ro/SS-A autoimmune response.
onchocerciasis	IL-8	Negative	PMID:15210803	Brattig NW, Bazzocchi C, Kirschning CJ, Reiling N, Buttner DW, Ceciliani F, Geisinger F, Hochrein H, Ernst M, Wagner H, Bandi C, Hoerauf A: The major surface protein of Wolbachia endosymbionts in filarial nematodes elicits immune responses through TLR2 and TLR4. J Immunol. 2004 Jul 1;173(1):437-45. More than 150 million humans in tropical countries are infected by filarial nematodes which harbor intracellular bacterial endosymbionts of the genus Wolbachia (Rickettsiales). These bacteria have been implicated in adverse effects of drug treatment in filariasis. The present study provides evidence that purified major Wolbachia surface protein (rWSP) acts as an inducer of the innate immune system through TLR2 and TLR4: 1) recombinant, stringently purified rWSP elicited the release of TNF-alpha, IL-12, and IL-8 from cultured blood cells of both Onchocerca volvulus-infected and uninfected people; 2) the inflammatory response to rWSP challenge was TLR2- and TLR4-dependent as demonstrated with TLR-transfected fibroblastoid cells, as well as macrophages and dendritic cells from functional TLR-deficient mice; 3) blood cells of onchocerciasis patients exposed to rWSP also generated down-regulating mediators IL-10 and PGE (2) after 6 days of culture; 4) furthermore, rWSP-reactive IgG1 Abs were present in sera of O. volvulus-infected people but not in those of uninfected Europeans. The lack of rWSP-reactive IgE and IgG4 in serum indicated a bias toward a Th1-type adaptive immune response. Abs against rWSP stained endobacteria in living and degenerating adult O. volvulus filariae, tissue microfilariae and host tissue macrophages that apparently had engulfed microfilariae. Thus, filarial helminths, through products of their endobacteria such as WSP, acquire characteristics of a typical microbial pathogen inducing immune responses via TLR2 and TLR4.
onchocerciasis	IL-2	Positive	PMID:8706329	Luder CG, Schulz-Key H, Banla M, Pritze S, Soboslay PT: Immunoregulation in onchocerciasis: predominance of Th1-type responsiveness to low molecular weight antigens of Onchocerca volvulus in exposed individuals without microfilaridermia and clinical disease. Clin Exp Immunol. 1996 Aug;105(2):245-53. Chronic and generalized onchocerciasis is associated with suppression of the parasite-specific cellular responsiveness, while exposed individuals without parasitological and clinical evidence of infection (endemic normals) display prominent cellular reactivity to Onchocerca volvulus antigens (OvAg). In order to identify those parasite antigens which may account for this differential cellular responsiveness, total adult worm-derived OvAg were fractionated by means of preparative SDS-PAGE and blot-elution into 22 antigen fractions of continuously decreasing molecular weight. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from microfilariae (mf)-positive onchocerciasis patients (n = 18) proliferated weakly in response to all OvAg fractions. In contrast, in vitro reactivity of PBMC from endemic normals (n = 9) was depressed in response to OvAg of mol. wt 200-30 kD only, while antigens of mol. wt observed in response to OvAg of mol. wt 15-11 kD. Furthermore, these low mol. wt antigen fractions induced substantial production of IL-2 and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in PBMC from endemic normals, but not in those from onchocerciasis patients. Cells from individuals of both groups secreted similar amounts of IL-5 in response to all OvAg fractions, with highest production again being induced by low mol. wt OvAg. In contrast, PBMC from onchocerciasis patients clearly produced more IL-10 than did cells from endemic normals. This augmented IL-10 production by PBMC from mf-positive individuals was not only observed after stimulation with OvAg fractions, but was measured in unstimulated control cultures as well. IFN-gamma-specific mRNA in antigen-stimulated PBMC from endemic normals appeared to be more prominent than in cells from onchocerciasis patients. However, mRNA transcripts of IL-10 and IL-13 were clearly present in patients, but were absent or inconsistently observed in endemic normals. Our results suggest that vigorous Th1-type cellular responsiveness encountered in endemic normals is restricted to low mol. wt antigens of O. volvulus, while such reactivity will not be present in mf-positive individuals. Furthermore, spontaneous production of high levels of IL-10 in onchocerciasis patients is likely to suppress Th1-type immunity, and thus may favour manifestation of chronic onchocerciasis. These traits of cellular immunity may contribute to the differential outcome of O. volvulus infection, the manifestation of clinical disease, and may also regulate the build up of acquired immunity in humans.

Clin Exp Immunol. 1994 May;96(2):238-44. The present study examined the quantitative and qualitative changes registered in the parasite-specific antibody response, cellular reactivity and cytokine production profile in onchocerciasis patients repeatedly treated with ivermectin over a period of 8 years. The densities of Onchocerca volvulus microfilariae (mf) in treated patients remained significantly reduced, whereas the number of permanently amicrofilaridermic patients (subclinical infection) increased with repeated treatments. In vitro cellular responses to O. volvulus antigen (OvAg) were highest (P volvulus (endemic normals). Cellular reactivity in repeatedly treated patients was higher at 84 than at 36 months post initial treatment (p.i.t); furthermore, the proliferative responses to OvAg, mycobacterial purified protein derivative (PPD) and streptococcal SL-O were greater (P onchocerciasis patients. In amicrofilaridermic patients such reactivity approached the magnitude observed in endemic normals. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from patients and endemic normals produced equivalent amounts of IL-2, IL-4 and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in response to mitogenic stimulation with phytohaemagglutinin (PHA); in response to OvAg, however, significantly more IL-2 and IFN-gamma were produced by PBMC from subclinical amicrofilaridermic patients or endemic normals than by mf-positive patients. OvAg-specific production of IL-4 by PBMC from treated patients was lower at 84 than at 36 months p.i.t. At three months p.i.t. the titres of circulating OvAg-specific IgG1-3 had increased (P declined with repeated treatments. Only IgG1 and IgG4 bound to OvAg of mol. wt 2-12 kD at 1 month p.i.t., while recognition of OvAg of mol. wt 10-200 kD by IgG1, IgG2 and IgG4 reached a maximum intensity at 3-6 months p.i.t., with the overall intensity of binding to OvAg gradually weakening thereafter. These results suggest that onchocerciasis-associated immunosuppression is reversible following ivermectin-induced permanent clearance of microfilariae from the skin; and that a vigorous parasite-specific cellular reactivity and a sustained production of IL-2 and IFN-gamma in amicrofilaridermic individuals may contribute to controlling O. volvulus infection.
onchocerciasis	IL-2	Positive	PMID:8099937	Steel C, Nutman TB: Regulation of IL-5 in onchocerciasis. J Immunol. 1993 Jun 15;150(12):5511-8. A critical role for IL-2. . The cytokine profiles of PBMC obtained from individuals "immune" to Onchocerca volvulus infection were compared to those from infected individuals. The immune individuals had significantly higher levels of both IL-2 and IL-5 in response to parasite Ag than did those individuals with active infection (mean IL-2 = 1.3 and 0.138 U/ml, respectively; mean IL-5 = 973 and 147.4 pg/ml, respectively), and there was a direct correlation between the production of IL-2 and IL-5. To examine the mechanism underlying the possible association between these two cytokines in patients infected with onchocerciasis, reverse transcription followed by polymerase chain reaction was used to measure IL-5 mRNA. In response to rIL-2, IL-5 mRNA appeared as early as early as 3 h after stimulation of patient PBMC, reaching a peak at 24 h; further, this response was inhibited with neutralizing antibodies to IL-2. IL-2 was unable to induce mRNA expression for IL-4, IFN-gamma, IL-10, or granulocyte-macrophage-CSF. To assess whether IL-2 was specifically responsible for the up-regulation of Ag-induced IL-5 production in patients with onchocerciasis, IL-5 mRNA expression was measured in PBMC stimulated with parasite Ag. Up-regulation of IL-5 mRNA was seen in all patients (peaking at 72 h) in response to Ag stimulation and was found to be independent of proliferation to Ag; in addition, this up-regulation was specifically inhibited by neutralizing anti-IL-2 antibodies. Further, the primary source of IL-5 mRNA was determined to be CD4+ T cells. These findings suggest that IL-2 production is required to induce IL-5 and further implicates IL-5 as a possible mediator of protection in onchocerciasis.
onchocerciasis	IL-2	Positive	PMID:2892372	Pedersen BK, Bygbjerg IC, Svenson M: Increase in natural killer cell activity during diethylcarbamazine treatment of patients with filariasis. Acta Trop. 1987 Sep;44(3):353-5. Two patients, one with Bancroftian filariasis and the other with onchocerciasis, and two healthy controls were treated with diethylcarbamazine (DEC). The natural killer (NK) cell activity of the two patients increased during DEC treatment to 2.5 and 2.8 times, respectively, while that of the controls remained unchanged. We conclude that the augmentation of baseline NK cell activity, as well as interferon- and interleukin-2-enhanced NK cell activity seen in the patients, is not a direct effect of DEC, but is related to the reaction to DEC in lymphatic filariasis and onchocerciasis.

Cell-mediated immune responses, and production and effects of IL-1 and IL-2 with Onchocerca volvulus infection. Nine of eighteen chimpanzees inoculated with infective third-stage larvae of Onchocerca volvulus developed patent infection with microfilariae in skin biopsies. In all infected chimpanzees the in vitro cellular reactivity to O. volvulus adult worm-derived Ag (OvAg) increased significantly after exposure to third-stage larvae. However, during prepatency the in vitro cellular responses to OvAg decreased gradually in subsequently mf positive (patent) animals, and returned with patency to values not different to those before infection. In non-patent chimpanzees cellular responses remained significantly higher than before infection. Stimulation of PBMC in vitro with bacterial Ag and mitogen did not show any differences between the experimental groups through 20 months p.i. The addition of exogenous IL-2 did not restore the impaired responses of PBMC to OvAg in patent animals. Exogenous IL-2 elicited an additive increase of the cellular response to OvAg in nonpatent, and a mitogenic effect to OvAg in patent animals. Selective depletion of adherent, suppressor/cytotoxic (CD8+), NK cells (CD16+) and the use of autologous serum had no effect on antigenic and mitogenic cellular responsiveness. OvAg-induced IL-2 production decreased after patency, whereas, IL-1 production was significantly greater in both patent and nonpatent than in control chimpanzees. In summary, these data demonstrate that experimental O. volvulus infection in chimpanzees stimulated a substantial cell-mediated immune response. In patent chimpanzees an OvAg-specific cellular hyporesponsiveness occurred before onset of patency, possibly due to decreased IL-2 production and responsiveness.
onchocerciasis	DP-alpha	Positive	PMID:8854084	Meyer CG, Schnittger L, May J: Met-11 of HLA class II DP alpha 1 first domain associated with onchocerciasis. Exp Clin Immunogenet. 1996;13(1):12-9. Human infection with the pathogenic tissue nematode Onchocerca volvulus may result in a spectrum of clinical manifestations or in a putatively immune condition. A methionine at amino acid position 11 of the HLA class II DP alpha 1 chain correlates with the occurring disease after infection (relative risk 3.3). The alternative alanine at position 11 is, conversely, associated with protection from disease ("relative protection' 3.5). DPA1*0301 is associated with the localized form of disease after O. volvulus infection.

onchocerciasis	glutathione-S-transferase	Positive	PMID:9270737	Liebau E, Spillner E, Henkle-Duhrsen K: pOVEX vector: prokaryotic expression and purification of onchocerciasis vaccine candidate antigens as fusion proteins with the 24 kD Onchocerca volvulus glutathione S-transferase. Trop Med Int Health. 1997 Jul;2(7):691-4. An expression vector, pOVEX, has been designed and constructed, combining the advantages of the expression vectors pGEX-3X and pJC2o. The pOVEX vector produces a fusion protein with the 24 kD Onchocerca volvulus glutathione S-transferase (OvGST2) which is easy to purify in one step from bacterial extracts under non-denaturing conditions using glutathione-sepharose chromatography. High yields of fusion protein were produced from this T7 RNA polymerase-dependent expression vector, which were then cleaved by digestion with the factor Xa protease to separate the OVGST2 polypeptide from the expressed protein of interest. This vector will be particularly useful to O. volvulus investigators for the production of O. volvulus antigens for the analyses of host humoral and cellular responses to these proteins and for immunization studies.
onchocerciasis	glutathione-S-transferase	Positive	PMID:8349749	Ogunrinade AF, Chandrashekar R, Eberhard ML, Weil GJ: Preliminary evaluation of recombinant Onchocerca volvulus antigens for serodiagnosis of onchocerciasis. J Clin Microbiol. 1993 Jul;31(7):1741-5. Serodiagnostic assays for onchocerciasis based on native antigens are hampered by the scarcity of antigen, and they suffer from poor specificity. The present study was designed to evaluate the diagnostic utility of recently described recombinant Onchocerca volvulus antigens OC 3.6 and OC 9.3 in enzyme immunoassays. The recombinant proteins were expressed as glutathione S-transferase fusions and were tested in several enzyme immunoassay formats to measure immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgG4 antibodies with sera from patients with onchocerciasis in Nigeria and with various types of control sera. The best results were obtained by measuring IgG4 antibodies to the fusion proteins. Forty of 42 (95%) serum specimens from patients with onchocerciasis were reactive with OC 3.6; the reactivity with OC 9.3 was 81%. Results obtained with sera from experimentally infected chimpanzees suggest that OC 3.6 might be especially useful for detecting prepatent infections in humans, while OC 9.3 mainly detects mature, patent infections. Sera from individuals in Nigeria and the United States residing in areas nonendemic for onchocerciasis were uniformly nonreactive with these antigens in IgG and IgG4 assays, as were sera from patients with bancroftian filariasis, brugian filariasis, loiasis, ascariasis, schistomiasis, and dracunculiasis. These results suggest that enzyme immunoassays based on the recombinant antigens OC 3.6 and OC 9.3 are useful for the diagnosis of onchocerciasis.
onchocerciasis	TLR4	Negative	PMID:15210803	Brattig NW, Bazzocchi C, Kirschning CJ, Reiling N, Buttner DW, Ceciliani F, Geisinger F, Hochrein H, Ernst M, Wagner H, Bandi C, Hoerauf A: The major surface protein of Wolbachia endosymbionts in filarial nematodes elicits immune responses through TLR2 and TLR4. J Immunol. 2004 Jul 1;173(1):437-45. More than 150 million humans in tropical countries are infected by filarial nematodes which harbor intracellular bacterial endosymbionts of the genus Wolbachia (Rickettsiales). These bacteria have been implicated in adverse effects of drug treatment in filariasis. The present study provides evidence that purified major Wolbachia surface protein (rWSP) acts as an inducer of the innate immune system through TLR2 and TLR4: 1) recombinant, stringently purified rWSP elicited the release of TNF-alpha, IL-12, and IL-8 from cultured blood cells of both Onchocerca volvulus-infected and uninfected people; 2) the inflammatory response to rWSP challenge was TLR2- and TLR4-dependent as demonstrated with TLR-transfected fibroblastoid cells, as well as macrophages and dendritic cells from functional TLR-deficient mice; 3) blood cells of onchocerciasis patients exposed to rWSP also generated down-regulating mediators IL-10 and PGE (2) after 6 days of culture; 4) furthermore, rWSP-reactive IgG1 Abs were present in sera of O. volvulus-infected people but not in those of uninfected Europeans. The lack of rWSP-reactive IgE and IgG4 in serum indicated a bias toward a Th1-type adaptive immune response. Abs against rWSP stained endobacteria in living and degenerating adult O. volvulus filariae, tissue microfilariae and host tissue macrophages that apparently had engulfed microfilariae. Thus, filarial helminths, through products of their endobacteria such as WSP, acquire characteristics of a typical microbial pathogen inducing immune responses via TLR2 and TLR4.
onchocerciasis	S-antigen	Positive	PMID:2378211	Van der Lelij A, Rothova A, Stilma JS, Vetter JC, Hoekzema R, Kijlstra A: Humoral and cell-mediated immune response against human retinal antigens in relation to ocular onchocerciasis. Acta Leiden. 1990;59(1-2):271-83. Autoimmune mechanisms are thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of the chorioretinal changes in ocular onchocerciasis. The humoral autoimmune response was determined by measuring serum levels of autoantibodies, directed against human S-antigen and interphotoreceptor retinoid binding protein (IRBP) using an enzyme immunoassay. The cell-mediated immune response to these antigens and a crude retinal extract was investigated by means of a two-step migration inhibition factor assay. Patients with onchocerciasis (n = 50) were subdivided into three groups: 1. without ocular involvement (n = 10), 2. with ocular onchocerciasis limited to the anterior segment (n = 19), 3. with onchocercal chorioretinopathy (n = 21). A group of endemic controls from Sierra Leone, West Africa were also studied. The cellular immune response to Concanavalin A was measured to assess the general capacity of lymphocytes to respond to a mitogen. High levels of anti-human S-antigen and IRBP antibodies were detected in patients with onchocerciasis and endemic controls. The levels of both anti-human S-antigen and IRBP antibodies were significantly higher in onchocerciasis patients compared to endemic controls (Mann-Whitney ranksum test; p less than 0.001 respectively 0.002). No relationship could be demonstrated between the anti-retinal antibody level and the occurrence of chorioretinitis in ocular onchocerciasis. The occurrence of the anti-retinal antibodies as a result of crossreactivity of anti-retinal antibodies with parasitic antigens or of induction of polyclonal B-cell activation due to parasitic infection is discussed, since high antibody levels were also found in patients with Bancroftian filariasis from Papua New Guinea and Surinam. The migration inhibition factor assay, in which the cell-mediated immune response to human S-antigen, IRBP and retinal extract was tested, showed that four out of 50 (8%) patients with onchocerciasis and four out of 25 (16%) endemic controls reacted with at least one retinal antigen. From the patients with onchocercal chorioretinopathy two out of 21 (10%) showed a positive cellular response. The general mitogen response tested with Con A was positive in all these individuals. In conclusion, circulating antibodies against human S-antigen or human IRBP are thus nor specific for onchocerciasis and in themselves not sufficient to cause chorioretinopathy in onchocerciasis, although their pathogenic role in an ongoing chorioretinitis cannot be excluded. Furthermore a role for a cell-mediated anti-retinal autoimmune mechanism in the pathogenesis of chorioretinitis in onchocerciasis as studied with human S-antigen, IRBP or crude retinal extract could not be demonstrated.
onchocerciasis	S-antigen	Positive	PMID:2365568	Van der Lelij A, Doekes G, Hwan BS, Vetter JC, Rietveld E, Stilma JS, Kijlstra A: Humoral autoimmune response against S-antigen and IRBP in ocular onchocerciasis. Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci. 1990 Jul;31(7):1374-80. Autoimmune mechanisms are thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of the chorioretinal changes in ocular onchocerciasis. In this study, the involvement of autoimmunity against retinal antigens in developing chorioretinitis was investigated. Serum levels of autoantibodies, directed against human S-antigen and interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP), were determined in patients with onchocerciasis (n = 46) and endemic controls (n = 38) from Sierra Leone with the use of an enzyme immunoassay. In both groups high levels of anti-human S-antigen and IRBP antibodies were detected. No relationship could be demonstrated between the antiretinal antibody level and the occurrence of chorioretinitis in onchocerciasis. The levels of both anti-human S-antigen and IRBP antibodies were significantly higher in patients with onchocerciasis compared with endemic controls (P less than 0.001). Cross-reactivity of antiretinal antibodies with parasitic antigens could not be demonstrated as a possible explanation for the higher levels in patients with onchocerciasis. No correlation was found between the levels of antibodies of different classes against the crude Onchocerca volvulus, the egg antigen, or the microfilariae and the antiretinal antibody levels. Furthermore, in a panel of 13 different monoclonal antibodies directed against O. volvulus, only one showed a slight anti-human IRBP reactivity and none reacted with S-antigen. The immune response against the two retinal antigens investigated was not specific for onchocerciasis because high antibody levels were also found in patients with Bancroftian filariasis from Papua, New Guinea, and Surinam.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
onchocerciasis	IL-13	Positive	PMID:11825773	Hoerauf A, Kruse S, Brattig NW, Heinzmann A, Mueller-Myhsok B, Deichmann KA: The variant Arg110Gln of human IL-13 is associated with an immunologically hyper-reactive form of onchocerciasis (sowda). Microbes Infect. 2002 Jan;4(1):37-42. Onchocerca volvulus infection usually results in a predominantly immunopermissive reaction called generalized onchocerciasis and characterized by high microfilarial burden and immunological tolerance to the worms. Rarely, however, infection leads to the sowda form of the disease displaying low microfilarial numbers, i.e. microfilarial control, and a T helper 2 (Th2)-type immune response including high immunoglobulin (Ig) E levels, and interleukin (IL)-13 being one of the key cytokines. The aim of this study was to investigate a possible association of a variant of the IL-13 gene, which confers an IgE-independent risk for asthma and atopy, with the immunologically hyper-reactive sowda form of onchocerciasis. Genotyping for the IL-13 variant Arg110Gln revealed a highly significant association of Arg110Gln with the sowda form (relative risk of 2.98, n = 19 patients), whereas the frequency of the variant was significantly lower in patients with generalized onchocerciasis (n = 92 individuals). Sowda patients had higher IgE levels than those with generalized onchocerciasis. Logistic regression analysis revealed that IgE and IL-13 are independent variables, each increasing the relative risk for sowda. Arg110Gln has been suggested to lead to enhanced IL-13 signaling and thus may be involved in shifting the immune reaction towards the hyper-reactivity characteristic for the sowda form, thereby promoting defense mechanisms.
onchocerciasis	chemokine	Positive	PMID:16232219	Fendt J, Hamm DM, Banla M, Schulz-Key H, Wolf H, Helling-Giese G, Heuschkel C, Soboslay PT: Chemokines in onchocerciasis patients after a single dose of ivermectin. . Clin Exp Immunol. 2005 Nov;142(2):318-26. Ivermectin treatment will effectively diminish microfilariae (Mf) of Onchocerca volvulus in the skin of patients, but therapy is associated with adverse host inflammatory responses. To investigate the association of proinflammatory chemokines with the intensity of infection and clinical adverse reactions, chemokine serum levels were measured in patients following ivermectin treatment (100 microg/kg, 150 microg/kg or 200 microg/kg) or placebo. The density of O. volvulus Mf per mg skin decreased by 85%, 97%, 97% and 90% at day 3, at month 3, month 6 and at 1 year post-ivermectin. The cutaneous T cell-attracting chemokine (CTACK/CCL27) was found highly elevated in onchocerciasis patients compared to infection-free European controls (P = 0.0004) and it did not change following ivermectin or placebo to 1 year post-therapy. The chemokine RANTES/CCL5 (regulated on activated and normally T cell-expressed) was similarly high in onchocerciasis patients and infection-free European controls; the RANTES/CCL5 levels did not change following treatment until 6 months post-therapy but were slightly elevated at 1 year post-therapy (P thymus and activation regulated chemokine (TARC/CCL17) and macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC/CCL22), were activated at 3 days post-ivermectin (P protein (MIP)-1alpha/CCL3 and MIP-1beta/CCL4 were low before ivermectin treatment, but following clearance of microfilariae of O. volvulus their levels increased from 6 months post-therapy onwards (for both at 12 months post-therapy, P ivermectin or with the serum levels of MIP-1alpha/CCL3, MIP-1beta/CCL4, TARC/CCL17, MDC/CCL22 and CTACK/CCL27. Our observations suggest that following ivermectin, macrophages as well as memory Th2-type lymphocytes and B cells, attracted and activated by MDC/CCL22, TARC/CCL17 and CTACK/CCL27, may contribute to dermal immune responses and O. volvulus Mf killing and clearance. The transient changes of TARC/CCL17 and MDC/CCL22 were not associated with clinical adverse responses, and the later rise of MIP-1alpha/CCL3 and MIP-1beta/CCL4 showed a reactivation of Type 1 immune responses associated with persistent low levels of O. volvulus microfilariae and an expiring O. volvulus infection.

Acta Trop. 1998 Jun 30;70(2):217-31. In onchocerciasis, variations of the host's immune responsiveness produce a spectrum of clinical manifestations ranging from the common generalized to the rare hyperreactive form (sowda). For further characterization of the immune response, the localization and frequency of mast cells in onchocercomas from untreated and ivermectin-treated patients with hyperreactive onchocerciasis from Liberia and the Yemen were analysed and compared to the generalized form by immunohistochemistry with antibodies specific for human mast cell tryptase and chymase, histamine and IgE. The nodules were selected with special regard to only one pair of live, microfilariae-producing Onchocerca volvulus. Throughout the nodular tissue of the hyperreactive form, mast cells accumulated in the strong inflammatory infiltrates, especially near eosinophils and around cellular attacks on microfilariae as well as perivascularly. Their number was significantly higher in the whole nodular tissue compared to the generalized form. The highest numbers occurred in the nodule centre. Mast cells carried IgE and appeared activated. No mast cells were observed in the cystic parts or attached to adult worms or microfilariae. In onchocercomas, 1 and 3 days after treatment with ivermectin, microgranuloma formation by eosinophils and macrophages around damaged microfilariae was enhanced and accompanied by numerous mast cells. Attacks of neutrophils were also pronounced, but attacks by mast cells were not observed. In conclusion, hyperreactivity against microfilariae in onchocercomas clearly correlates with a strong mastocytosis and IgE production parallel to tissue eosinophilia.
onchocerciasis	IL-10	Positive	PMID:17302900	Mai CS, Hamm DM, Banla M, Agossou A, Schulz-Key H, Heuschkel C, Soboslay PT: Onchocerca volvulus-specific antibody and cytokine responses in onchocerciasis patients after 16 years of repeated ivermectin therapy. Clin Exp Immunol. 2007 Mar;147(3):504-12. The recommended control option against onchocerciasis is repeated ivermectin treatment, which will need to be implemented for decades, and it remains unknown how repeated ivermectin therapy might affect immunity against Onchocerca volvulus in the long term. O. volvulus-specific antibody reactivity and cellular cytokine production were investigated in onchocerciasis patients receiving ivermectin (150 microg/kg) annually for 16 years. In treated patients, the T helper type 2 (Th2) cytokine interleukin (IL)-5 and T regulatory IL-10 in response to O. volvulus antigen (OvAg) and bacteria-derived Streptolysin O (SL-O) diminished to levels found in infection-free endemic controls; also, cellular release of Th1-type interferon (IFN)-gamma at 16 years post initial ivermectin treatment (p.i.t.) approached control levels. In ivermectin-treated onchocerciasis patients, IL-5 production in responses to the mitogen phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) decreased, but IL-10 in response PHA increased, and neither attained the cytokine production levels of endemic controls. At 16 years p.i.t., O. volvulus-specific IgG1 and IgG4 subclass reactivity still persisted at higher levels in onchocerciasis patients than in O. volvulus exposed but microfilariae-free endemic controls. In addition, cytokine responses remained depressed in onchocerciasis patients infected concurrently with Mansonella perstans and Necator americanus or Entamoeba histolytica/dispar. Thus, long-term ivermectin therapy of onchocerciasis may not suffice to re-establish fully a balanced Th1 and Th2 immune responsiveness in O. volvulus microfilariae-negative individuals. Such deficient reconstitution of immune competence may be due to an as yet continuing and uncontrolled reinfection with O. volvulus, but parasite co-infections can also bias and may prevent the development of such immunity.

The present study provides evidence that purified major Wolbachia surface protein (rWSP) acts as an inducer of the innate immune system through TLR2 and TLR4: 1) recombinant, stringently purified rWSP elicited the release of TNF-alpha, IL-12, and IL-8 from cultured blood cells of both Onchocerca volvulus-infected and uninfected people; 2) the inflammatory response to rWSP challenge was TLR2- and TLR4-dependent as demonstrated with TLR-transfected fibroblastoid cells, as well as macrophages and dendritic cells from functional TLR-deficient mice; 3) blood cells of onchocerciasis patients exposed to rWSP also generated down-regulating mediators IL-10 and PGE (2) after 6 days of culture; 4) furthermore, rWSP-reactive IgG1 Abs were present in sera of O. volvulus-infected people but not in those of uninfected Europeans. The lack of rWSP-reactive IgE and IgG4 in serum indicated a bias toward a Th1-type adaptive immune response. Abs against rWSP stained endobacteria in living and degenerating adult O. volvulus filariae, tissue microfilariae and host tissue macrophages that apparently had engulfed microfilariae. Thus, filarial helminths, through products of their endobacteria such as WSP, acquire characteristics of a typical microbial pathogen inducing immune responses via TLR2 and TLR4.
onchocerciasis	IL-10	Positive	PMID:9806045	Cooper PJ, Espinel I, Paredes W, Guderian RH, Nutman TB: Impaired tetanus-specific cellular and humoral responses following tetanus vaccination in human onchocerciasis: a possible role for interleukin-10. J Infect Dis. 1998 Oct;178(4):1133-8. Onchocerca volvulus infection has been associated with impaired cellular responses to parasite antigens, an impairment that may also extend to nonparasite antigens. To investigate the mechanism of this impaired immune response, the effect of concurrent O. volvulus infection on the immune response to tetanus toxoid (TT) following tetanus vaccination was studied. The proliferative, cytokine, and antibody response to TT of O. volvulus-infected subjects (n = 19) and comparable noninfected controls (n = 20) were studied before and 6 months after vaccination with TT. Following vaccination, antibody levels, proliferative responses, and levels of interferon-gamma were significantly greater in noninfected subjects (P produced interleukin-10, but noninfected controls did not (P volvulus can diminish the immune response to an unrelated antigen (TT) by a mechanism that is likely to involve interleukin-10.
onchocerciasis	IL-10	Positive	PMID:9294549	Brattig NW, Henkle-Duhrsen KH, Hounkpatin S, Liebau E, Kruppa TF, Zipfel PF: Characterization of human immune responses to the cytosolic superoxide dismutase and glutathione S-transferase from Onchocerca volvulus. Trop Med Int Health. 1997 Aug;2(8):788-98. In onchocerciasis patients and in O. volvulus-exposed individuals without signs of onchocericiasis, T- and B-cell responses to two recombinantly expressed O. volvulus enzymes were analysed and compared to responses to total protein extract of adult parasites. The cytosolic enzymes Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase 1 (OvSOD1) and glutathione S-transferase 2 (OvGST2) represent 2 detoxifying molecules which may play an important role in parasite defense against host-induced oxidative stress. The T-cell response to the two recombinant proteins was analysed by investigating the cytokine responses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Induction of IL-5 at the mRNA level and IL-5 and IL-10 at the protein level was demonstrated in patients with the generalized form of onchocerciasis and endemic normals without clinical manifestations. IFN-gamma was not found to be induced by either antigen. This pattern of lymphokine expression is indicative of a Th2-type response. Compared to patients with the generalized form, a higher level of cytokine induction was observed in the group of endemic normals. Low but significant IgG levels were observed against OvSOD1 in patients with onchocerciasis; higher antibody levels were found against OvGST2 in patients and endemic normals. The highest IgG levels were detected against the crude O. volvulus extract. These results indicate that the two recombinant O. volvulus proteins induce moderate T and B cell responses.
onchocerciasis	IL-10	Positive	PMID:8706329	Luder CG, Schulz-Key H, Banla M, Pritze S, Soboslay PT: Immunoregulation in onchocerciasis: predominance of Th1-type responsiveness to low molecular weight antigens of Onchocerca volvulus in exposed individuals without microfilaridermia and clinical disease. Clin Exp Immunol. 1996 Aug;105(2):245-53. Chronic and generalized onchocerciasis is associated with suppression of the parasite-specific cellular responsiveness, while exposed individuals without parasitological and clinical evidence of infection (endemic normals) display prominent cellular reactivity to Onchocerca volvulus antigens (OvAg). In order to identify those parasite antigens which may account for this differential cellular responsiveness, total adult worm-derived OvAg were fractionated by means of preparative SDS-PAGE and blot-elution into 22 antigen fractions of continuously decreasing molecular weight. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from microfilariae (mf)-positive onchocerciasis patients (n = 18) proliferated weakly in response to all OvAg fractions. In contrast, in vitro reactivity of PBMC from endemic normals (n = 9) was depressed in response to OvAg of mol. wt 200-30 kD only, while antigens of mol. wt observed in response to OvAg of mol. wt 15-11 kD. Furthermore, these low mol. wt antigen fractions induced substantial production of IL-2 and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in PBMC from endemic normals, but not in those from onchocerciasis patients. Cells from individuals of both groups secreted similar amounts of IL-5 in response to all OvAg fractions, with highest production again being induced by low mol. wt OvAg. In contrast, PBMC from onchocerciasis patients clearly produced more IL-10 than did cells from endemic normals. This augmented IL-10 production by PBMC from mf-positive individuals was not only observed after stimulation with OvAg fractions, but was measured in unstimulated control cultures as well. IFN-gamma-specific mRNA in antigen-stimulated PBMC from endemic normals appeared to be more prominent than in cells from onchocerciasis patients. However, mRNA transcripts of IL-10 and IL-13 were clearly present in patients, but were absent or inconsistently observed in endemic normals. Our results suggest that vigorous Th1-type cellular responsiveness encountered in endemic normals is restricted to low mol. wt antigens of O. volvulus, while such reactivity will not be present in mf-positive individuals. Furthermore, spontaneous production of high levels of IL-10 in onchocerciasis patients is likely to suppress Th1-type immunity, and thus may favour manifestation of chronic onchocerciasis. These traits of cellular immunity may contribute to the differential outcome of O. volvulus infection, the manifestation of clinical disease, and may also regulate the build up of acquired immunity in humans.
onchocerciasis	interleukin	Negative	PMID:9226684	Winkler S, Paiha S, Winkler H, Graninger W, Marberger M, Steiner GE: Microfilarial clearance in loiasis involves elevation of Th1 and Th2 products and emergence of a specific pattern of T-cell populations. Parasite Immunol. 1996 Sep;18(9):479-82. Diethylcarbamazine (DEC) induced clearance of microfilaraemia in loiasis is associated with severe posttreatment reactions. To define the switch from hypo- to hyper-responsiveness associated with DEC treatment, phenotypic alterations of T-lymphocytes, characterized by flow cytometry, and cytokines, determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, were monitored in a microfilaraemic patient. In contrast to reports on onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariases, no elevation of interleukin (IL)-6 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha was observed. The most severe side effects coincided with an elevation of interferon (IFN)-gamma on day 3, followed by IL-10, transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta 2 and macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha (MIP-1 alpha) peaking on day 5. Phenotypically, T-cell activation markers CD38, CD54 and CD25 were significantly expressed before treatment, with high CD38 expression still existing one year after clearance of microfilaraemia. Treatment-related increases were observed with anti-CD122, anti-HLA-DR and anti-CD69. CD28 was expressed before treatment on almost 100% of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and dropped to 20% by day 5, reaching again baseline levels on day 21. Furthermore, there emerged 20% TCR alpha beta+/CD3+ T cells and 10% anti-beta V5 (c)+ T cells, altogether indicating a specific pattern of T-helper (Th) 1 and Th2 cytokines as well as expansion of certain pauciclonal T-cell populations in response to microfilarial clearance.
onchocerciasis	IL-4	Positive	PMID:10583601	Hogarth PJ, Bianco AE: Interleukin-12 modulates T-cell responses to microfilariae but fails to abrogate interleukin-5-dependent immunity in a mouse model of onchocerciasis. Immunology. 1999 Nov;98(3):406-12. Infection of mice with microfilariae of Onchocerca lienalis induces high levels of protective immunity to reinfection, which is dependent on interleukin (IL)-5 but not IL-4. Here, we have investigated the effect of exogenous IL-12 administration during either the priming or effector phases of the immune response. When administered during priming, IL-12 induced down-regulation of parasite-specific serum immunoglobulin (Ig) E and up-regulation of IgG2a. Antigen-specific IL-4 responses were strongly suppressed, whilst blood eosinophil levels were partially reduced. When administered during a challenge infection, IL-12 did not significantly influence the balance of antibody isotypes, but partially reduced eosinophil production. Antigen-specific IL-4 responses were again completely ablated. Unusually, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) responses were not significantly affected following IL-12 administration, either during priming or after challenge infections. Moreover, despite a fall in antigen-specific IL-5 production, the expression of IL-5-dependent immunity, as determined by reduction in worm recoveries, was fully maintained. These data demonstrate that parasite-induced IL-4 can be abrogated without affecting protective immunity to Onchocerca microfilariae in mice. In view of the established role of IL-4 in pathogenesis, this may have important implications for the development of immunoprophylaxis aimed at microfilariae and the alleviation of pathology in onchocerciasis.
onchocerciasis	IL-4	Positive	PMID:9717193	Johnson EH, Schynder-Candrian S, Rajan TV, Nelson FK, Lustigman S, Abraham D: Immune responses to third stage larvae of Onchocerca volvulus in interferon-gamma and interleukin-4 knockout mice. Parasite Immunol. 1998 Jul;20(7):319-24. To shed clarity on the dichotomy of reported results relative to the significance of T helper-1 vs T helper-2 immune responses in onchocerciasis, we compared the survivability of Onchocerca volvulus third-stage larvae (L3) in immunized mice that had either a targeted disruption of the Interleukin-4 or Interferon-gamma gene. Treatment groups consisted of control mice and mice immunized with irradiated O. volvulus L3. All mice were challenged with diffusion chambers containing viable L3. Vaccinated IL-4-/- were unable to kill this larval target. In contrast, vaccinated INF-gamma-/- and C57BL/6 mice, exhibited high levels of killing, had elevated levels of IL-4 and significantly greater numbers of eosinophils in their diffusion chambers than the IL-4-/-. Whereas, levels of IFN-gamma in all three groups of immunized mice were equivalent to those of control mice, levels of IL-5 were elevated, even in the IL-4-/-, indicating that cytokines other than IL-4 were involved in its production. The protective immune response to third-stage larvae of O. volvulus in mice vaccinated with irradiated larvae has an absolute IL-4 requirement.
onchocerciasis	SS-A	Positive	PMID:1602002	Lux FA, McCauliffe DP, Buttner DW, Lucius R, Capra JD, Sontheimer RD, Lieu TS: Serological cross-reactivity between a human Ro/SS-A autoantigen (calreticulin) and the lambda Ral-1 antigen of Onchocerca volvulus. J Clin Invest. 1992 Jun;89(6):1945-51. We have cloned and sequenced a 46-kD Ro/SS-A autoantigen gene that is the human homologue of the calcium-binding protein, calreticulin. The sequence of this 46-kD Ro/SS-A protein (calreticulin) has significant homology to lambda Ral-1, a recombinant cDNA clone corresponding to a major antigen of the nematode, Onchocerca volvulus, the infectious agent of onchocerciasis. We therefore sought to determine whether antibodies produced by onchocerciasis patients might crossreact with the human 46-kD Ro/SS-A autoantigen (calreticulin). 20 of 22 sera from Liberian onchocerciasis patients who had no known evidence of autoimmune disease were found to contain antibodies that reacted with the 46-kD Ro/SS-A (calreticulin) by immunoblot analysis. Characteristic of sera reactive with Ro/SS-A antigens, some onchocerciasis sera also immunoprecipitated the Ro/SS-A-associated hY RNAs. In addition, a monoclonal antibody raised against O. volvulus organisms reacted to purified human WiL-2 cell 46 kD Ro/SS-A antigen (calreticulin) by ELISA. These results strongly suggest that onchocerciasis patients produce antibodies that crossreact with the 46-kD human Ro/SS-A autoantigen (calreticulin) and raise the possibility that infectious organisms such as O. volvulus might play a triggering or exacerbating role in the human Ro/SS-A autoimmune response.

Am J Trop Med Hyg. 1996 May;54(5):490-7. An Onchocerca volvulus expression library was differentially screened to identify a molecular marker distinguishing sowda (lichenified onchodermatitis) from other onchocerciasis forms. One clone, PG3, was recognized by pooled sera from patients with sowda, but not by pooled sera from patients with generalized onchocerciasis; it was not recognized by sera from patients with lymphatic filariasis or other helminth infections. The DNA of PG3 hybridized strongly with O. volvulus Eco RI-digested DNA, but not with DNA from Brugia spp., Trichinella spp., and humans. A weak reaction was observed with DNA from O. gibsoni and Acanthocheilonema viteae. The PG3 DNA sequence showed a high homology with both human and nematode collagens. Confirmation of the collagen-like nature of the sowda-specific PG3 product was obtained by amino terminal sequencing of the PG3 expression product, as well as by demonstrating its susceptibility to collagenase digestion. The characteristic recognition of the O. volvulus collagen specified by clone PG3 was confirmed by measuring antibody levels to the expressed product in individual sowda and generalized onchocerciasis sera, respectively. Identification of a nematode collagen antigen mainly recognized in sowda patients raises the possibility that this extreme form of dermatitis might arise through cross-reactivity between anti-O. volvulus collagen antibodies and human collagen. However, a relationship between the PG3 recognition by antibodies and the sowda pathogenesis could not be demonstrated.
onchocerciasis	HLA-DQ	Positive	PMID:9328789	Murdoch ME, Payton A, Abiose A, Thomson W, Panicker VK, Dyer PA, Jones BR, Maizels RM, Ollier WE: HLA-DQ alleles associate with cutaneous features of onchocerciasis. Hum Immunol. 1997 Jun;55(1):46-52. The Kaduna-London-Manchester Collaboration for Research on Onchocerciasis. Onchocerciasis is associated with a spectrum of cutaneous changes, ranging from clinically normal skin to acute and chronic pathology. An important aspect of disease expression may be the level of immune response to parasite antigens, which is likely to be regulated by MHC-encoded molecules. We therefore investigated HLA class I and class II phenotypes in Nigerian residents of an area endemic for onchocerciasis. All study subjects were carefully characterized for parasite load and skin pathology. Individuals with depigmentation had increased frequencies of DQA1*0501 and DQB1*0301 compared with persons with normal skin and high microfilarial load (NSHMF) (Odds Ratios 3.6 (95% CI 1.0 to 13.2) and 3.8 (1.0 to 15.2), respectively). Conversely, individuals with depigmentation had a decreased frequency of DQA1*0101 and Cw6 compared with NSHMF (Odds Ratios 0.2 (0.1 to 0.9) and 0.1 (0.02 to 0.8), respectively). When NSHMF subjects were examined by age, a further decrease in DQA1*0501 frequency and increase in DQA1*0101 frequency were observed in older NSHMF individuals. These results strongly suggest that there is an immunogenetic basis for the spectrum of cutaneous presentations in onchocerciasis and that HLA-DQ molecules are associated with the level of immune response to parasite antigens.

onchocerciasis	IL-6	Positive	PMID:8077726	Njoo FL, Hack CE, Oosting J, Luyendijk L, Stilma JS, Kijlstra A: C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 are elevated in onchocerciasis patients after ivermectin treatment. J Infect Dis. 1994 Sep;170(3):663-8. Ivermectin treatment of onchocerciasis can induce adverse reactions. Mechanisms underlying these reactions are poorly understood but may include activation of neutrophils. This study investigated the acute-phase response in onchocerciasis patients during 2 days after ivermectin treatment. The acute-phase protein C-reactive protein (CRP) and cytokines that mediate the acute-phase response (tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF alpha] and interleukin-6 [IL-6]) were measured in 144 skin snip-positive onchocerciasis patients and 12 skin snip-negative controls who received one dose of ivermectin (150 micrograms/kg). No elevated TNF alpha levels were found, but IL-6 and CRP were elevated in 25.7% and 50.7% of the patients, respectively, after ivermectin treatment. Most patients (89.2%) with raised IL-6 also had raised CRP. Such increases were not observed in controls and in patients were correlated with adverse reactions and microfilarial densities. These findings suggest a possible role of the acute-phase response in microfilarial destruction following ivermectin treatment.
onchocerciasis	IL-6	Positive	PMID:2036808	Van der Lelij A, Rothova A, De Vries JP, Vetter JC, Van Haren MA, Stilma JS, Kijlstra A: Analysis of aqueous humour in ocular onchocerciasis. Curr Eye Res. 1991 Feb;10(2):169-76. The development of an onchocercal chorioretinopathy from the first detectable signs to a full blown oncho fundus is not fully understood. We investigated the intraocular humoral immune response against Onchocerca volvulus, human S-antigen, IRBP and crude retinal extract (using an ELISA) by examining paired aqueous humour and serum samples obtained from onchocerciasis patients (without [n = 10] and with ocular symptoms [n = 8]) and endemic controls [n = 14] from Sierra Leone (West Africa). A local intraocular anti-retinal IgG antibody production could not be demonstrated in onchocerciasis patients, whether they had ocular symptoms or not. A significantly higher level of O. volvulus antibodies and IgG was measured in the aqueous of onchocerciasis patients with ocular involvement, as compared to patients without ocular symptoms (Mann-Whitney ranksum test; p less than 0.001 and p less than 0.02 respectively). Since interleukin-6 (IL-6) plays an essential role in the differentiation of B cells into immunoglobulin producing plasma cells, we therefore measured this cytokine in paired aqueous and serum samples. Elevated IL-6 levels were found in the aqueous of two out of eight onchocerciasis patients tested. In view of these findings it seems improbable that retinal autoimmunity is a major factor in the pathogenesis of onchocercal chorioretinopathy. The high intraocular levels of antibodies against the parasite suggest a direct involvement of the parasite in the pathogenesis of onchocercal chorioretinopathy.
onchocerciasis	heat-shock-protein-60	Negative	PMID:10779593	Wu Y, Egerton G, Ball A, Tanguay RM, Bianco AE: Characterization of the heat-shock protein 60 chaperonin from Onchocerca volvulus. Mol Biochem Parasitol. 2000 Apr 15;107(2):155-68. Chaperonin 60 (cpn60) belongs to the group of ubiquitous molecular chaperones that comprise the heat shock proteins, nucleoplasmins and chaperonins. Antibodies to recombinant CPN60 from humans was used to screen a cDNA library of Onchocerca volvulus and antigen-positive clones were selected. Sequencing of the DNA inserts confirmed their identity as cpn60 transcripts. These are distinct from a cpn60 sequence recorded previously from O. volvulus (GenBank accession number Y09416) that appears to be of endobacterial origin, rather than derived from the parasite itself. The full-length sequence of the cDNA (designated Ov-cpn60) codes for a protein of 64.3kDa (598 amino acid residues) and shares significant identity with homologous gene products from Caenorhabditis elegans (72%), humans (69%), yeast (53%) and Escherichia coli (50%). The endobacterial and parasite sequences are 41% conserved. Ov-CPN60 migrates with an apparent molecular mass of 65kDa on SDS-PAGE and is present in all life-cycle stages, as determined by immunoblotting with rabbit antibodies raised against the recombinant protein. Immunogold electron microscopy identified the protein within mitochondria, as expected, but also in extra-mitochondrial sites, including inclusion bodies of the glandular oesophagus (in infective larvae), the uterine wall, cytosol of developing spermatids, and the hypodermis and cuticle. Endobacteria were also labelled, indicating cross-reactivity between CPN60 from the parasite and its intracellular symbiont. In human infections, serum antibodies to Ov-CPN60 were present in only 11% of cases from Ecuador, but in 81-89% of subjects in three separate foci from West Africa. There was no relationship between antibody levels and age, sex, or infection intensity, and no consistent association between the serological response and immune status. An evaluation of antibody specificities in individual sera revealed a mixture of parasite-specific and host crossreactive anti-CPN60 antibodies, the ratio of which varied amongst geographic areas. It is concluded that antibody responses to Ov-CPN60 are unlikely to contribute either to host protection or pathology in onchocerciasis.
onchocerciasis	interphotoreceptor-retinoid-binding-protein	Positive	PMID:2365568	Van der Lelij A, Doekes G, Hwan BS, Vetter JC, Rietveld E, Stilma JS, Kijlstra A: Humoral autoimmune response against S-antigen and IRBP in ocular onchocerciasis. Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci. 1990 Jul;31(7):1374-80. Autoimmune mechanisms are thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of the chorioretinal changes in ocular onchocerciasis. In this study, the involvement of autoimmunity against retinal antigens in developing chorioretinitis was investigated. Serum levels of autoantibodies, directed against human S-antigen and interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP), were determined in patients with onchocerciasis (n = 46) and endemic controls (n = 38) from Sierra Leone with the use of an enzyme immunoassay. In both groups high levels of anti-human S-antigen and IRBP antibodies were detected. No relationship could be demonstrated between the antiretinal antibody level and the occurrence of chorioretinitis in onchocerciasis. The levels of both anti-human S-antigen and IRBP antibodies were significantly higher in patients with onchocerciasis compared with endemic controls (P less than 0.001). Cross-reactivity of antiretinal antibodies with parasitic antigens could not be demonstrated as a possible explanation for the higher levels in patients with onchocerciasis. No correlation was found between the levels of antibodies of different classes against the crude Onchocerca volvulus, the egg antigen, or the microfilariae and the antiretinal antibody levels. Furthermore, in a panel of 13 different monoclonal antibodies directed against O. volvulus, only one showed a slight anti-human IRBP reactivity and none reacted with S-antigen. The immune response against the two retinal antigens investigated was not specific for onchocerciasis because high antibody levels were also found in patients with Bancroftian filariasis from Papua, New Guinea, and Surinam.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Acta Trop. 1998 Jun 30;70(2):217-31. In onchocerciasis, variations of the host's immune responsiveness produce a spectrum of clinical manifestations ranging from the common generalized to the rare hyperreactive form (sowda). For further characterization of the immune response, the localization and frequency of mast cells in onchocercomas from untreated and ivermectin-treated patients with hyperreactive onchocerciasis from Liberia and the Yemen were analysed and compared to the generalized form by immunohistochemistry with antibodies specific for human mast cell tryptase and chymase, histamine and IgE. The nodules were selected with special regard to only one pair of live, microfilariae-producing Onchocerca volvulus. Throughout the nodular tissue of the hyperreactive form, mast cells accumulated in the strong inflammatory infiltrates, especially near eosinophils and around cellular attacks on microfilariae as well as perivascularly. Their number was significantly higher in the whole nodular tissue compared to the generalized form. The highest numbers occurred in the nodule centre. Mast cells carried IgE and appeared activated. No mast cells were observed in the cystic parts or attached to adult worms or microfilariae. In onchocercomas, 1 and 3 days after treatment with ivermectin, microgranuloma formation by eosinophils and macrophages around damaged microfilariae was enhanced and accompanied by numerous mast cells. Attacks of neutrophils were also pronounced, but attacks by mast cells were not observed. In conclusion, hyperreactivity against microfilariae in onchocercomas clearly correlates with a strong mastocytosis and IgE production parallel to tissue eosinophilia.
onchocerciasis	Eotaxin	Positive	PMID:10794432	Cooper PJ, Beck LA, Espinel I, Deyampert NM, Hartnell A, Jose PJ, Paredes W, Guderian RH, Nutman TB: Eotaxin and RANTES expression by the dermal endothelium is associated with eosinophil infiltration after ivermectin treatment of onchocerciasis. Clin Immunol. 2000 Apr;95(1 Pt 1):51-61. The roles of eotaxin, RANTES, and MCP-3 expression in eosinophil recruitment to the site of parasite killing that occurs following ivermectin treatment of onchocerciasis were assessed in the skin of 13 Onchocerca volvulus-infected subjects and two noninfected controls before and after ivermectin treatment. Adverse reactions in infected subjects were associated with the appearance of eosinophils in the dermis as part of a perivascular inflammatory infiltrate. Although no expression of RANTES and eotaxin was seen in dermal vascular endothelial cells in biopsies taken before treatment (nor at any time in the skin of uninfected controls), endothelial expression of both eotaxin and RANTES was noted by 24 h following treatment. While RANTES expression was transient, eotaxin expression increased in parallel with increasing eosinophil recruitment up to 60 h posttreatment. These observations indicate that endothelial expression of eotaxin and RANTES may have an important role in eosinophil recruitment into the skin during helminth-killing reactions.

In recent years, associations of particular factors of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system with two major infectious diseases of tropical countries have been recognized: common West African HLA antigens are associated with protection from severe Plasmodium falciparum malaria, and HLA-D alleles are associated with generalized disease, localized disease and putative immunity in Onchocerca volvulus infection. Here, Christian Meyer and Peter Kremsner summarize current information on the involvement of HLA factors in P. falciparum malaria and O. volvulus infection, and briefly report on HLA-related immunological characteristics of various conditions in these infectious diseases.

Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1994 Aug 2;91(16):7515-9. Human infections with the tissue nematode Onchocerca volvulus result in a variety of clinical conditions that possibly include protective immunity. In a West African area hyperendemic for human onchocerciasis, 120 residents were classified according to clinical and laboratory findings as presenting with generalized onchocerciasis, localized onchocerciasis, or as being putatively immune. The three groups differed in the distribution of HLA-D variants as determined by DNA typing. The most pronounced differences were found among alleles of the DQ loci. The haplotype DQA1*0501-DQB1*0301 was significantly more frequent among putatively immune individuals than among patients with generalized or localized disease. Conversely, DQA1*0101-DQB1*0501 and, independently, the allele DQB1*0201 were more frequent in generalized disease than in localized disease or putative immunity. In these correlations, the frequencies of allelic variants were in localized disease intermediate to those of the two other groups. The only distinct association found with localized disease was that of the DP allele DPB1*0402. The findings indicate that HLA-D variants influence the course of O. volvulus infection and help to define a state that may reflect protective immunity.
onchocerciasis	desmoglein-1	Positive	PMID:15610512	Diaz LA, Arteaga LA, Hilario-Vargas J, Valenzuela JG, Li N, Warren S, Aoki V, Hans-Filho G, Eaton D, dos Santos V, Nutman TB, de Mayolo AA, Qaqish BF, Sampaio SA, Rivitti EA: Anti-desmoglein-1 antibodies in onchocerciasis, leishmaniasis and Chagas disease suggest a possible etiological link to Fogo selvagem. J Invest Dermatol. 2004 Dec;123(6):1045-51. Pemphigus foliaceus (PF) and the endemic form Fogo Selvagem (FS) are mediated by pathogenic antibodies to the EC1-2 domains of desmoglein-1. There is a preclinical phase with antibodies to only EC5. Based on geographic clustering of cases, FS is thought to have an, as yet unidentified, environmental trigger. In this study we have searched for anti-desmoglein-1 antibodies in sera from parasitic (leishmaniasis, Chagas, and onchocerciasis), and infectious diseases (leprosy and South American (SA) blastomycosis), which are prevalent in the same geographic regions of Brazil as FS. A specific and sensitive desmoglein-1 ELISA detected antibodies in 34 of 41 onchocerciasis (83%), 38 of 88 leishmaniasis (43%), 18 of 31 Chagas disease (58%), 7 of 28 SA blastomycosis (25%), and 14 of 83 leprosy sera (17%). These sera recognized epitopes restricted to the EC5 domain. These findings identify several etiological factors for FS. It is hypothesized that a component of insect vector saliva, rather than the parasite itself may trigger an antibody response to EC-5. In persons with the known HLA susceptibility alleles and living in endemic areas, a response to the EC1-2 domains may subsequently develop by epitope spreading with associated clinical signs of FS.
onchocerciasis	Cam1	Negative	PMID:1598508	Engelbrecht F, Eisenhardt G, Turner J, Sundaralingam J, Owen D, Braun G, Connor V, Taylor DW: Analysis of antibody responses directed against two Onchocerca volvulus antigens defined by monoclonal antibodies. Trop Med Parasitol. 1992 Mar;43(1):47-53. Monoclonal antibodies, reactive with antigens solubilised from the body wall of intact female Onchocerca volvulus using 2% 2-beta-mercaptoethanol, have been characterised. Two IgG1 antibodies, Cam1 and Cam28, recognised antigens of apparent molecular weights of 18,000 and 28,000; and 120,000, respectively. The target antigens of Cam1 and Cam28 could be localised in the cuticle. Inhibition ELISAs showed that target epitopes of both monoclonal antibodies induce an antibody response in onchocerciasis patients. 153 sera from Sierra Leonean patients were tested for their individual antibody levels against antigen epitopes recognised by Cam1 and Cam28. Patients within the age of 5-8 years had the highest levels of antibodies against the Cam28-epitope, whereas patients above 60 years had almost none. Amicrofilaremic patients had higher anti-Cam28 antibody levels than microfilaremic patients and there was a significant difference between groups with no chronic skin disease and those with mild or severe signs. A high percentage of patients (80.4%) recognised the Cam1-epitope, highest antibody levels being found in patients within the age group of 15 to 45 years and in microfilaremic patients. However, levels of antibodies inhibiting monoclonal antibody Cam1 could not be correlated with presence or absence of skin disease.
onchocerciasis	interferon	Negative	PMID:2892372	Pedersen BK, Bygbjerg IC, Svenson M: Increase in natural killer cell activity during diethylcarbamazine treatment of patients with filariasis. Acta Trop. 1987 Sep;44(3):353-5. Two patients, one with Bancroftian filariasis and the other with onchocerciasis, and two healthy controls were treated with diethylcarbamazine (DEC). The natural killer (NK) cell activity of the two patients increased during DEC treatment to 2.5 and 2.8 times, respectively, while that of the controls remained unchanged. We conclude that the augmentation of baseline NK cell activity, as well as interferon- and interleukin-2-enhanced NK cell activity seen in the patients, is not a direct effect of DEC, but is related to the reaction to DEC in lymphatic filariasis and onchocerciasis.
onchocerciasis	keratin	Positive	PMID:7539474	Chandrashekar R, Curtis KC, Weil GJ: Molecular characterization of a parasite antigen in sera from onchocerciasis patients that is immunologically cross-reactive with human keratin. J Infect Dis. 1995 Jun;171(6):1586-92. Onchocerca volvulus is a nematode that causes severe dermatitis and blindness in humans. Prior studies have shown that immune complexes in sera from onchocerciasis patients contain parasite antigens with M (r) of 23,000 and 65,000-70,000. Monoclonal antibody OV-1 binds to these antigens and to corresponding antigens in adult worm extracts and in vitro culture supernatants. OV-1 was used to immunoscreen an O. volvulus adult worm cDNA library. Clone OV1CF contains a 1632-bp open-reading frame that codes for a protein with a predicted M (r) of 63,000. The deduced protein sequence of OV1CF has 78% identity with Ascaris lumbricoides intermediate filament A and 40%-50% identity with several mammalian intermediate filaments. Antibodies raised to OV1CF bind to human keratin, and some sera from onchocerciasis patients contain antibodies to OV1CF and to keratin. Thus, immune complexes from onchocerciasis patients contain a parasite antigen that is immunologically cross-reactive with human intermediate filament proteins.
onchocerciasis	C-reactive-protein	Positive	PMID:8077726	Njoo FL, Hack CE, Oosting J, Luyendijk L, Stilma JS, Kijlstra A: C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 are elevated in onchocerciasis patients after ivermectin treatment. J Infect Dis. 1994 Sep;170(3):663-8. Ivermectin treatment of onchocerciasis can induce adverse reactions. Mechanisms underlying these reactions are poorly understood but may include activation of neutrophils. This study investigated the acute-phase response in onchocerciasis patients during 2 days after ivermectin treatment. The acute-phase protein C-reactive protein (CRP) and cytokines that mediate the acute-phase response (tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF alpha] and interleukin-6 [IL-6]) were measured in 144 skin snip-positive onchocerciasis patients and 12 skin snip-negative controls who received one dose of ivermectin (150 micrograms/kg). No elevated TNF alpha levels were found, but IL-6 and CRP were elevated in 25.7% and 50.7% of the patients, respectively, after ivermectin treatment. Most patients (89.2%) with raised IL-6 also had raised CRP. Such increases were not observed in controls and in patients were correlated with adverse reactions and microfilarial densities. These findings suggest a possible role of the acute-phase response in microfilarial destruction following ivermectin treatment.
onchocerciasis	granulocyte-macrophage-colony-stimulating-factor	Positive	PMID:10722581	Turaga PS, Tierney TJ, Bennett KE, McCarthy MC, Simonek SC, Enyong PA, Moukatte DW, Lustigman S: Immunity to onchocerciasis: cells from putatively immune individuals produce enhanced levels of interleukin-5, gamma interferon, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor in response to Onchocerca volvulus larval and male worm antigens. Infect Immun. 2000 Apr;68(4):1905-11. Antigen-specific interleukin-5 (IL-5), gamma interferon (IFN-gamma), and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) responses in individuals living in an area of hyperendemicity for onchocerciasis in Cameroon were examined. The responses against antigens prepared from Onchocerca volvulus third-stage larvae (L3), molting L3 (mL3), and crude extract from adult males (M-OvAg) were compared to the responses against antigens from adult female worms and skin microfilariae. Cytokine responses for the putatively immune individuals (PI) and the infected individuals (INF) were compared. A differential cytokine profile of IL-5 (Th2 phenotype) and IFN-gamma (Th1 phenotype) was found in these individuals in response to the antigens. In both the PI and the INF, Th2 responses against all the antigens tested were dominant. However, in the PI group as a whole, there was an enhanced Th2 response against the larval antigens and the adult male and adult female antigens, and a Th1 response in a subgroup of the PI (27 to 54.5%) against L3, mL3, and M-OvAg antigens was present. While the PI produced significantly higher levels of GM-CSF against L3, mL3, and M-OvAg antigens than the INF, there was no difference in the GM-CSF responses of the groups against the other antigens. The present study indicated that, in comparison to the INF, the PI have distinct larva-specific and adult male-specific cytokine responses, thus supporting the premise that immunological studies of the PI would lead to the identification of immune mechanisms and the target genes that play a role in protective immunity.
