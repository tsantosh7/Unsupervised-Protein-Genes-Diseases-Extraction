__label__Positive	Four out of the twelve cancer tissue specimens, one specimen of cancer ascites cells and the NIH: OVCAR-3 cancer cell line showed elevated amplification of c-Ki-ras, as compared to the human fibroblast cell line FS4 and normal ovarian tissues.
__label__Positive	Six1 overexpression in ovarian carcinoma causes resistance to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis and is associated with poor survival.
__label__Positive	Here, we show that the developmental regulator Six1 is overexpressed in ovarian carcinoma cell lines (OCC) compared with normal ovarian surface epithelium.
__label__Negative	In addition, Six1 overexpression renders OCC resistant to tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL)-mediated apoptosis, and Six1 knockdown in the TRAIL-resistant SKOV3 ovarian carcinoma line dramatically sensitizes the cells to TRAIL.
__label__Positive	In addition, Six1 overexpression renders OCC resistant to tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL)-mediated apoptosis, and Six1 knockdown in the TRAIL-resistant SKOV3 ovarian carcinoma line dramatically sensitizes the cells to TRAIL.
__label__Positive	Six1 was overexpressed in 50% of the early-stage (stage I) and 63% of the late-stage (stages II, III, and IV) ovarian carcinomas examined, with late-stage carcinomas expressing approximately 3-fold higher Six1 mRNA levels on average compared with early-stage tumors.
__label__Negative	We have previously shown that acquisition of cisplatin resistance by OAW42-R ovarian carcinoma cells was associated with the loss of ERK activation in response to cisplatin.
__label__Negative	Downmodulation of caveolin-1 expression in human ovarian carcinoma is directly related to alpha-folate receptor overexpression.
__label__Positive	Downmodulation of caveolin-1 expression in human ovarian carcinoma is directly related to alpha-folate receptor overexpression.
__label__Positive	SKOV3, but not two alphaFR-negative non-ovarian cell lines, exhibited down-regulation of cav-1 expression following stable alphaFR cDNA transfection.
__label__Negative	SKOV3, but not two alphaFR-negative non-ovarian cell lines, exhibited down-regulation of cav-1 expression following stable alphaFR cDNA transfection.
__label__Positive	Conversely, cav-1 transfection in IGROV1 cells led to downregulated alphaFR expression, together with formation of caveolar structures and reduction of growth capability.
__label__Positive	Moreover, cav-1 expression was induced in IGROV1 cells by transfection with intracellular anti-alphaFR antibodies to downmodulate alphaFR expression.
__label__Negative	Moreover, cav-1 expression was induced in IGROV1 cells by transfection with intracellular anti-alphaFR antibodies to downmodulate alphaFR expression.
__label__Positive	Moreover, cav-1 expression was induced in IGROV1 cells by transfection with intracellular anti-alphaFR antibodies to downmodulate alphaFR expression.
__label__Negative	Attenuating hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α expression via small interference RNA resulted in a significantly decreased hCG expression in OVCAR-3, which indicated that the effect of hypoxia on hCG expression was mediated through HIF-1α.
__label__Positive	Expression level of vascular marker and HIF-1α in OVCAR-3 increased in response to hCG treatment in a dose-dependent manner.
__label__Positive	Increased expression of CD146, a cell adhesion molecule, has been reported to be closely associated with an advanced stage of malignant melanoma, prostate cancer, and ovarian cancer.
__label__Positive	IL-1 and CDDP treatment induced p53 protein in NIH:OVCAR-3 tumor cells.
__label__Negative	Taken together, these studies suggest that IL-1 may kill ovarian NIH:OVCAR-3 tumor cells by inducing a blockade at G1/S of the cell cycle, down-regulating c-myc gene and inducing p53-dependent apoptosis.
__label__Positive	Ovarian carcinoma and breast carcinoma cells which are multiply drug resistant due to overexpression of P-glycoprotein are markedly less resistant to cryptophycin than they are to vinblastine, colchicine, and taxol.
__label__Positive	Cyclin E is overexpressed in breast, lung, skin, gastrointestinal, cervical, and ovarian cancers.
