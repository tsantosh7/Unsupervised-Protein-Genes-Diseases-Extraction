775,Positive,"The down-regulation of ICAM-1 by short hairpin RNA in MCF10A cells led to the induction of psoriasin, calgranulin-A, calgranulin-B, and MUC1, and we demonstrated that these up-regulations were not ROS dependent."
776,Negative,"The down-regulation of ICAM-1 by short hairpin RNA in MCF10A cells led to the induction of psoriasin, calgranulin-A, calgranulin-B, and MUC1, and we demonstrated that these up-regulations were not ROS dependent."
777,Positive,Our findings suggest that the down-regulation of ICAM-1 in mammary epithelial cells may contribute both to the high expression of psoriasin seen in some high-grade DCIS tumors and to the induction of MUC1.
778,Negative,Our findings suggest that the down-regulation of ICAM-1 in mammary epithelial cells may contribute both to the high expression of psoriasin seen in some high-grade DCIS tumors and to the induction of MUC1.

784,Negative,Our findings suggest loss of E-cadherin expression in some breast cancers may be due to dominant repression of the trans-acting pathways that regulate E-cadherin transcription.
785,Positive,Heregulin and agonistic anti-p185(c-erbB2) antibodies inhibit proliferation but increase invasiveness of breast cancer cells that overexpress p185(c-erbB2): increased invasiveness may contribute to poor prognosis.
786,Positive,PKC-zeta is required for angiotensin II-induced activation of ERK and synthesis of C-FOS in MCF-7 cells.
787,Negative,"When the epidermal growth factor-receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase activity was inhibited by the use of its inhibitor AG1478, Ang II was still able to induce ERK1/2 phosphorylation and c-fos expression, therefore proving that the transactivation of EGFR was not required for these Ang II effects in MCF-7 cells."
788,Positive,"When the epidermal growth factor-receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase activity was inhibited by the use of its inhibitor AG1478, Ang II was still able to induce ERK1/2 phosphorylation and c-fos expression, therefore proving that the transactivation of EGFR was not required for these Ang II effects in MCF-7 cells."
789,Positive,"Our results suggest that in MCF-7 cells Ang II activates multiple signalling pathways involving PKC-zeta, PI3K and MAPK; of these pathways only PKC-zeta appears responsible for the induction of c-fos."
790,Positive,"In the former group, ErbB2 overexpression was strongly associated with increased risk of recurrence (RR = 4.7; 95% CI, 2.1-10.4) and breast cancer death (RR = 5.4; 95% CI, 2.3-12.6)."

794,Positive,"Up-regulation of AR by 1,25(OH)2D3 and of VDR by DHT provides evidence of cross-talk between 2 signaling pathways in OVCAR-3 cells."
795,Positive,Overexpression of p185(c-erbB2) (p185/NEU/HER2) by tumor cells is associated with a poor prognosis in many but not all studies of breast and ovarian cancer.
796,Positive,"Moreover, the poor prognosis of breast and ovarian cancers that overexpress p185(c-erbB2) could relate in part to enhanced invasiveness rather than to increased proliferative capacity."
797,Positive,"Evaluation of differential gene expression in drug-sensitive (A2780) and drug-resistant (A2780cp) ovarian carcinoma cell lines exposed to 0.1 microg/ml HMN-176 up to 48 h using cDNA microarrays with 1,154 known human genes revealed significant drug effects on tumor associated genes, including upregulation of tissue inhibitor matrix metalloproteinases gene (TIMP) in both cell lines, suggesting that HMN-176 could potentially overcome tumor drug resistance."
798,Positive,"This study showed that IL-18 serum levels were elevated in ovarian cancer patients and were correlated with overall survival, although they were shown not to be an independent prognostic factor."
799,Positive,"Overexpression of TUBB3 protein was observed in 56 (85%) of the 66 ovarian cancers, and was significantly associated with aggressive tumor behavior (advanced stage, presence of ascites, suboptimal cytoreduction at surgery and presence of lymph node metastasis) (P<0.05)."
800,Positive,"In 2 cell lines with weak expression of TUBB3 protein (OVCAR-3 and JHOC-8), TUBB3 induction was independently induced by treatment with 5-Aza-CdR (JHOC-8) or PBA (OVCAR-3), while neither agent markedly altered TUBB3 mRNA/protein expression in a strongly TUBB3-expressing cell line (JHOC-5)."
801,Positive,"A CpG island of another cell line showing faint expression of TUBB3 protein (OVCAR-3), in which a significant gain of TUBB3 expression was induced by treatment with PBA but not with 5-Aza-CdR, was hypomethylated, similarly to a cell line (JHOC-5) showing constitutive expression of TUBB3."
802,Positive,p53 accumulation in ovarian carcinomas and its prognostic implications.
803,Positive,These results suggest that p53 accumulation occurs more frequently in tumors with aggressive behavior and that p53 immunoreactivity may have a prognostic role in certain subsets of patients with ovarian carcinoma.
804,Positive,Induction of MDR1-gene expression by antineoplastic agents in ovarian cancer cell lines.
805,Positive,Induction of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase mRNA by platinum complexes in a human ovarian carcinoma cell line.
806,Positive,"Our previous studies have shown that sublines of human ovarian carcinoma cell line A2780, which exhibited low levels of resistance to oxaliplatin, showed elevated steady state levels of mRNA and activity of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (gamma-GT, EC 2.3.2.2), but not of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (gamma-GCS, EC 6.3.2.2) [El-akawi et al., Cancer Lett. 105:5-14; 1966]."
807,Negative,"Thus, ING1 mutation is very rare in breast or ovarian cancers, however, repression of ING1 expression frequently accompanies tumour development of breast cancer."

809,Positive,[Antitumor effect of endothelial progenitor cells with TRAIL gene transfection on ovarian carcinoma xenografts in nude mice].
810,Positive,"Lewis y overexpression led to an increase in both mRNA and protein expression levels of cyclin A, cyclin D1 and cyclin E in ovarian cancer cells, decrease in both mRNA and protein expression levels of p16 and p21, and decrease of p27 at only the protein expression level without change in its mRNA level."
811,Negative,"Lewis y overexpression led to an increase in both mRNA and protein expression levels of cyclin A, cyclin D1 and cyclin E in ovarian cancer cells, decrease in both mRNA and protein expression levels of p16 and p21, and decrease of p27 at only the protein expression level without change in its mRNA level."
