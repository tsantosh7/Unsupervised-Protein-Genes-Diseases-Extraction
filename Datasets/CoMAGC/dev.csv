__label__Negative	The observed relationship between the down-regulation of Bcl-2 and induction of apoptosis was not causal because stable overexpression of Bcl-2 resulted in protection of MCF-7 cells from the cytotoxic morphological changes and growth-inhibitory effects of butyrate (15% growth inhibition compared to 60% growth inhibition in the parental cells).

__label__Negative	When the epidermal growth factor-receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase activity was inhibited by the use of its inhibitor AG1478, Ang II was still able to induce ERK1/2 phosphorylation and c-fos expression, therefore proving that the transactivation of EGFR was not required for these Ang II effects in MCF-7 cells.
__label__Positive	When the epidermal growth factor-receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase activity was inhibited by the use of its inhibitor AG1478, Ang II was still able to induce ERK1/2 phosphorylation and c-fos expression, therefore proving that the transactivation of EGFR was not required for these Ang II effects in MCF-7 cells.
__label__Positive	Our results suggest that in MCF-7 cells Ang II activates multiple signalling pathways involving PKC-zeta, PI3K and MAPK; of these pathways only PKC-zeta appears responsible for the induction of c-fos.
__label__Positive	In the former group, ErbB2 overexpression was strongly associated with increased risk of recurrence (RR = 4.7; 95% CI, 2.1-10.4) and breast cancer death (RR = 5.4; 95% CI, 2.3-12.6).
