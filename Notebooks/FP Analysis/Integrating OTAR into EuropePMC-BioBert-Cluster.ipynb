Upon hyperoxic exposure, the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) is activated by a variety of proinflammatory cytokines both <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo</italic>. In the present study, we used a murine hyperoxic model to evaluate the effects of iNOS deficiency on the inflammatory response.</p></sec><sec sec-type=\"methods\"><title>Methods</title><p>Wild-type and iNOS-deficient mice were exposed to normoxia, 60% O<sub>2 </sub>or &gt;95% O<sub>2 </sub>for 72 h.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Exposure to &gt;95% O<sub>2 </sub>resulted in an increased iNOS mRNA and protein expression in the lungs from wild-type mice. No significant effects of iNOS deficiency on cell differential in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were observed. However, hyperoxia induced a significant increase in total cell count, protein concentration, LDH activity, lipid peroxidation, and TNF-α concentration in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid compared to iNOS knockout mice. Moreover, binding activity of NF-κB and AP-1 appeared to be higher in wild-type than in iNOS-deficient mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Taken together, our results provide evidence to suggest that iNOS plays a proinflammatory role in acute hyperoxic lung injury.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><sec><title>Background</title><p>Supplemental oxygen therapy is administered for the treatment of tissue hypoxia, most commonly in an intensive care setting of respiratory insufficient patients, though its potent toxicity is well described [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B1\">1</xref>]. The pathophysiology of oxygen injury is characterized by lung inflammation including activation and recruitment of neutrophils and alveolar macrophages, tissue and alveolar edema, surfactant dysfunction, and excess production of free radicals and inflammatory cytokines [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B2\">2</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B4\">4</xref>]. Although the exact mechanisms of pulmonary oxygen toxicity are still unknown, compelling evidence suggests that reactive oxygen species such as superoxide anion, hydroxyl radical, and hydrogen peroxide are important mediators of lung injury [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B5\">5</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B7\">7</xref>]. High oxygen concentrations induce cellular damage by several mechanisms such as oxidation of proteins, peroxidation of membrane lipids, and breakage of DNA strands [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B8\">8</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B10\">10</xref>]. Moreover, hyperoxia also induces the release of a wide spectrum of proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-<inline-graphic xlink:href=\"1465-9921-5-11-i1.gif\"></inline-graphic>[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B11\">11</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B13\">13</xref>]. However, the precise molecular mechanisms by which hyperoxia produces acute lung injury remain unclear.</p><p>Reactive oxygen species can also react with other free radicals such as nitric oxide (NO) to yield more cytotoxic species including peroxynitrite anion [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B14\">14</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>]. Peroxynitrite is a strong oxidizing agent that can also initiate lipid peroxidation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B16\">16</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B17\">17</xref>]. Since the discovery of NO as a potent vascular smooth muscle relaxant and regulator of blood pressure, NO generated by the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) has been identified in many cell types such as alveolar macrophages or epithelial cells and implicated in a variety of biological roles [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\">18</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B19\">19</xref>].</p><p>NO is synthesized from L-arginine by two main isoforms of the NO synthase: the constitutive and the inducible isoform [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B20\">20</xref>]. The NOS enzymes are complex homodimeric proteins consisting of a N-terminal oxygenase domain, a central calmodulin binding sequence, and a C-terminal reductase domain [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B21\">21</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B22\">22</xref>]. Inducible NOS is expressed following induction by a variety of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B22\">22</xref>] or by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B23\">23</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B25\">25</xref>]. Constitutive iNOS expression has been reported in the lung [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B26\">26</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B27\">27</xref>] and several inflammatory processes involving the lung, such as sepsis [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B23\">23</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B25\">25</xref>], asbestosis-induced lung injury [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B28\">28</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B29\">29</xref>] and hyperoxia [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B30\">30</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B31\">31</xref>] are associated with an elevated NO production. However, the effect of hyperoxia on endogenous NO production is a matter of controversial discussion, depending on the experimental conditions [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B30\">30</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B32\">32</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B34\">34</xref>].</p><p>Inappropriate regulation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)-and activator protein-1 (AP-1)-mediated transcription has also been associated with pathological conditions, including acute inflammation such as hyperoxic exposure [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B35\">35</xref>]. Intracellular signaling pathways leading to an activation of transcriptional regulators such as NF-κB and AP-1 can be affected by reactive oxygen and nitrogen species [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B36\">36</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>]. Both transcription factors are activated in lung cells after short periods of hyperoxic exposure. Binding sites for NF-κB and AP-1 are present in the promotor of the iNOS gene and of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B35\">35</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>].</p><p>The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of iNOS deficiency on acute hyperoxic lung injury. As indicators of lung hyperpermeability, lavageable lung protein and LDH activity were measured; lung lipid oxidation was assessed based on the levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances. To characterize the inflammatory process, lavageable cell counts, cell differential, and TNF-<inline-graphic xlink:href=\"1465-9921-5-11-i1.gif\"></inline-graphic> concentration were analyzed. Binding activity of NF-κB and AP-1 was investigated in order to elucidate transcriptional mechanisms for iNOS and TNF-α expression.</p></sec><sec sec-type=\"methods\"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Inducible NOS-deficient mice (C57BL6/J × 129SvEv) were originally provided by Dr. J.

Animals were randomized and exposed to 60% O<sub>2 </sub>and &gt;95% O<sub>2 </sub>with a gas flow rate of 6 l/min at atmospheric pressure for 72 h.

Several cellular systems including alveolar macrophages and leukocytes are involved in this process. Activation of inflammatory cells causes the release of reactive oxygen species and proinflammatory cytokines, resulting in endothelial dysfunction, tissue and alveolar edema formation, and surfactant inactivation. Furthermore, high levels of NO produced by inducible NO synthase may contribute to tissue damage. NO is directly cytotoxic or can combine with superoxide anions to form the more reactive oxidant peroxynitrite. Although a large amount of literature exists concerning the pulmonary response to oxidant exposure, some issues remain unresolved.</p><p>Our findings confirm previous results showing that hyperoxia is able to upregulate iNOS expression in lung tissue [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B30\">30</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B34\">34</xref>]. As expected, there was no expression of iNOS mRNA in lungs of iNOS knockout mice. In wild-type mice, exposure to 60% and &gt;95% O<sub>2 </sub>induced a significant increase in iNOS mRNA expression. This enhanced iNOS mRNA expression during hyperoxic exposure seems to contradict findings reported in a study published by Arkovitz and colleagues, in which hyperoxia did not induce iNOS expression in lungs of mice [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B32\">32</xref>]. This may be explained by the fact that the detection of iNOS mRNA by using northern blot technique is not as sensitive as RT-PCR. In accordance with results from others [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B28\">28</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B30\">30</xref>], we found little iNOS protein immunostaining under normoxic conditions and 60% oxygen exposure, while hyperoxic exposure &gt;95% O<sub>2 </sub>induced a prominent expression of iNOS protein in the lungs from wild-type mice (data not shown).</p><p>The data from the present study demonstrate that <italic>in vivo </italic>oxygen exposure significantly elevated total BAL cell count after 72 h &gt;95% O<sub>2 </sub>both in wild-type and in iNOS knockout mice. According to this, oxygen exposure resulted in a significant enhancement in the number of neutrophils and lymphocytes in BAL fluid, combined with a significant reduction in the number of alveolar macrophages both in wild-type and iNOS knockout mice. Dedhia et al. also found elevated numbers of neutrophils and lymphocytes combined with decreased numbers of alveolar macrophages in rat lungs [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B45\">45</xref>]. Recent studies report that, although iNOS deficiency does not affect leukocyte rolling and adhesion following treatment with thrombin [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B46\">46</xref>], iNOS-deficient mice have significantly elevated leukocyte accumulation and enhanced leukocyte-endothelium interactions in endotoxinemia [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B24\">24</xref>]. These results suggest that iNOS expression plays a potent role in regulation of leukocyte recruitment depending on the way of induction. Hyperoxia-induced inflammatory cell influx, particularly of neutrophils, can contribute to oxidant stress through formation of reactive oxygen species. Auten and collaborators demonstrated that DNA damage in hyperoxia-exposed rat lungs may be reduced by blocking neutrophil influx [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B47\">47</xref>]. In our model of oxidant injury, no effect of iNOS deficiency on BAL cell differentials could be made out, whereas total BAL cell counts were significantly elevated in wild-type mice compared to iNOS knockout mice. The increase in the number of neutrophils and lymphocytes in BAL fluid may partially reflect the loss of integrity of the endothelium barrier. This damage is indicated by a significant elevation of total protein concentration and LDH activity after acute hyperoxia in wild-type mice in comparison to iNOS knockout animals. Kleeberger and colleagues previously reported that iNOS expression is involved in ozone-induced lung hyperpermeability showing reduced mean BAL fluid protein and leukocyte accumulation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B48\">48</xref>].</p><p>Recent studies indicate that iNOS also plays a proinflammatory role in the development of asbestosis-related pulmonary disorders, measured as a significantly decreased total protein count, LDH activity, and nitrotyrosine staining in iNOS-deficient mice [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B27\">27</xref>]. In contrast, Kobayashi et al. reported that hyperoxia caused an increased accumulation of leukocytes, elevated LDH activity and albumin concentration, and a higher wet-dry-ratio in lungs from iNOS-deficient mice compared to wild-type animals [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B31\">31</xref>]. Based on their findings, these authors suggest the presence of an iNOS-independent pathway of lung nitration and injury in hyperoxia. In our study, we found that nitrosylation of proteins in the lungs of mice exposed to &gt;95% O<sub>2 </sub>was attenuated in iNOS-deficient mice (data not shown). Formation of nitrotyrosine was proposed as a relatively specific marker for detecting endogenous generation of peroxynitrite. However, recent evidence indicates that alternate reactions are capable of inducing nitration of tyrosine in proteins, for example the reaction of myeloperoxidase with hydrogen peroxide. Therefore, increased nitrotyrosine staining is considered as an indicator of \"increased nitrative stress\" rather than a \"footprint\" for the formation of peroxynitrite [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B49\">49</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B50\">50</xref>]. Amplified formation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species can be proved by determination of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, a secondary product of lipid peroxidation indicating oxidative and/or nitrative stress [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B9\">9</xref>]. In our study, significantly reduced formation of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances following &gt;95% oxygen exposure was found in iNOS knockout mice, again suggesting a beneficial effect of iNOS deficiency on oxidant lung injury.</p><p>Cytokines may also play a role in oxygen toxicity. Several studies point out that TNF-α is produced during hyperoxic exposure [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B51\">51</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B52\">52</xref>]. Furthermore, hyperoxia induces sequential formation of pulmonary TNF-α and IL-6, which corresponds to the severity of pathological findings [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B12\">12</xref>]. In our study, iNOS deficiency resulted in a significant decrease in BAL TNF-α concentration during hyperoxic exposure. Findings of Sass et al. also demonstrate that iNOS-derived NO regulates proinflammatory genes <italic>in vivo </italic>resulting in inflammatory liver injury in mice by stimulation of TNF-α production [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B53\">53</xref>]. To investigate whether hyperoxia-induced TNF-α expression was regulated on the level of protein or mRNA, activation of the redox-sensitive transcription factors NF-κB and AP-1 was analyzed. As recently described, NF-κB was activated following hyperoxia resulting in an increase in TNF-α and IFN-γ gene expression in murine pulmonary lymphocytes [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B35\">35</xref>]. Moreover, we found that the activation of both factors seen in wild-type mice was weaker in iNOS knockout mice suggesting that induction of iNOS upon hyperoxia may in fact activate these transcription factors. These findings contrast the silencing effect of NO on NF-κB demonstrated upon stimulation with LPS or silica [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B54\">54</xref>]. Data from Kupatt et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B55\">55</xref>] also indicate a negative feedback mechanism of eNOS-derived NO on activation of NF-κB following myocardial reoxygenation. In addition to isotype-specific differences in NO forming capacity, the synergistic NF-κB and AP-1 activation upon an reactive oxygen or nitrogen species challenge might diminish the inhibitory effect of NO. Recent studies indicate that exogenously administered NO causes increased c-fos and c-jun gene and protein expression combined with an evident AP-1 binding activity mediated by reactive oxygen and nitrogen species [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B56\">56</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Taken together, our data show that the absence of the iNOS gene does attenuate, but not fully abolish, oxidation, nitration, and cytotoxicity in response to acute hyperoxic exposure. The degree of transcriptional activation, inflammation, and oxidative lung injury caused by hyperoxia is significantly reduced in iNOS knockout mice compared to wild-type animals. In conclusion, these findings provide evidence to suggest that, upon hyperoxic exposure to &gt;95% O<sub>2</sub>, proinflammatory effects of iNOS may be predominant, thereby contributing to the extent of acute hyperoxic lung injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>AKH carried out the hyperoxic model, subsequent cytological and biochemical analyses, and writing and preparation of the manuscript.

       "'BM HSC could be lentivirally modified with long-term transgene expression without compromising cell differentiation or function as also shown in PB HSC [63]. Recently, lentivirally mediated gene therapy was shown to provide clinical benefits in an inheritable fatal demyelinating disease X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy [64]. HSC were transduced ex vivo to restore dysfunctional protein function and proper myelin maintenance and transplanted after myeloablative treatment. Even though less than 15% of leucocytes expressed the transgene, the progressive cerebral demyelination ceased. This suggests that introducing genetically modified leucocytes may work as a therapeutic approach, potentially also for other diseases. Microglia [14] and monocyte function [40,65] may be defective in AD. Introducing fresh monocytic cells into the circulation, whether migrating into the brain and acting as BM-derived microglia in the CNS or circulating in the periphery, may contribute to inflammatory activities in AD, reduction of Aβ and ameliorating AD pathology. It is still under debate which conditions are needed for cell migration: compromised BBB integrity or disease-induced conditions in the brain parenchyma [30,66] and to which extent the migration may occur [67, 68]. Gene modification may be utilized not only to enhance the migration of HSCM into the target area and promote their survival and function as cell-based therapy, but HSCM could also work as carriers for the therapeutic gene. We suggest HSCM to be utilized in future studies and novel therapeutics for AD.'"
